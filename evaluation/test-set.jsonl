Customers, however, do not even have to realize \nthat ML is at work. A service provider that offers a media summary for companies (e.g., all mentions of the company name in important \nmagazines), for example, had automated its process with ML, but the value proposition that the company delivered to customers \nremained unchanged (i.e., a standardized email, PDF report). \nIntelligent products and services. ML applications are also used to create new intelligent products and services that can be offered \ndirectly to customers. The offers may be sold as separate goods (e.g., smart devices, apps, or paid services) or are intended to increase \nthe service level of existing offers (e.g., to improve customer service). Typical of these novel offerings is that they would not be feasible \n(economically at least) without ML technology. In contrast to the process automation subtype, where ML alters internal business \nprocesses, these applications are customer facing and change the offering itself (we illustrate the customer contact with a separate box \nin the right part of Fig. 5). Often, customers can tailor such products and services to their needs. An example is a content provider we \ninterviewed that developed a service based on deep neural networks to automatically write penny novels. They offer this paid service \nto large publishing houses in order to generate content in an extremely cheap and fast way. At the time of our interview, the service was \n“currently able to influence the number of protagonists and … how creative this network should be … too much freedom usually ends \nup in some doomsday dystopia.” (P11: Automatic writing). Another example, focusing on offering customer service for existing \nproducts, is a chatbot deployed at an energy retailer to quickly answer simple questions from customers, so that they do not spend time \nin the queue at the call center. \nWe summarize the overall characteristics of the three identified value creation mechanisms in Table 1 and differentiate them \naccording to attributes that we described before. \nShifting ML value creation mechanisms \nWhile analyzing the ML value creation mechanisms of all projects in our sample, we made two observations. First, we identified \nconditions that need to be fulfilled for successfully leveraging the identified ML value creation mechanisms and, in turn, achieving the \naspired value targets. Second, we found that some ML applications changed their value creation mechanism over time and switched \nfrom one type to another. For example, there are over-ambitious ML automation projects which fail in the pilot project stage and, \nconsequently, are reconfigured to task augmentation projects. Some data-intensive research projects, on the other hand, can evolve \ninto ML systems that augment human tasks or fully automate processes. The following two vignettes illustrate the necessary conditions \nfor the value creation types and illustrate the fact that some ML applications reconfigure over time. To unpack this phenomenon of \nreconfiguration, we first describe the identified conditions for each value creation type below and then explain the observed trajec -\ntories of reconfiguring projects.   \nConditions for value creation mechanisms \nWe identified a set of necessary but not sufficient conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to successfully leverage the identified \nML value creation mechanisms. These conditions can be internal (e.g., necessary assets or capabilities) or external to the company (e. \ng., necessary environmental factors). The conditions apply to the value creation mechanisms and the respective subtypes. We illustrate \nall the identified conditions as part of the process model in Fig. 6 and further explain them below. Conditions are inherited from \nmechanism to mechanism from left to right (i.e., the knowledge creation mechanism has two necessary conditions, the task \nVignette 1: Churn management in energy retailing (project 1) \nAn analytics vendor developed an ML-based process automation application for energy retailers to identify customers that are \nlikely to cancel their contract (i.e., to churn). Based on the system’s predictions, customers with high churn probability would be \nautomatically approached with targeted advertising mail (value creation through partly automating customer communication). The \nchurn predictions worked successfully in the lab using historical training and test data, but it turned out that the system had no \neffect on actual customer churn rates in the first field tests. In addition, the utility company had technical problems feeding the \npredictions back into their CRM system, which should send out advertising mails to customers. As a reaction to these difficulties, \nthe project team started to investigate the drivers of customer churn to find out reasons for the good performance in the lab and \nthe bad performance in the field trial (value creation through knowledge creation about customers). Once such drivers were iden -\ntified, the vendor built a pilot and field tested in order to investigate how customers would react to targeted advertising in a \nchurn context. After several rounds of development and testing of the new predictive ML model, both the predictive accuracy of \nthe model and the estimated business impact of its implementation increased steadily. Eventually, the company integrated the \nchurn scores into their CRM system via a newly-built interface (value creation through task augmentation for account managers with \nhigh discretion to act on these insights). After that, the application was extended to include the scores in the company’s call center \nsystem. If the churn score of a customer exceeded a certain predefined threshold, the application prescribed specific questions for \nsales professionals to ask. Due to the fast response time in the call center, the agent has little chance to ask questions other than \nthe suggested ones (value creation through low-discretion task augmentation).  \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 9: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n10\ninfluencing customer behavior that our models spit out. They serve as a basis for discussion in the company about how one might \ndevelop new concepts.” (Translated; P03: Customer churn modeling). Such data-driven discoveries are usually represented as pa -\nrameters of a statistical model that, for example, explains customer churn. In the above-mentioned project, for instance, a pattern was \nidentified that for a one-unit increase in customer spending, the likelihood that customer churn decreases by a certain percentage \npoint. \nML value creation mechanism 2: Task augmentation \nThe second group of ML applications we identified (18 of 56 applications) pursued the value target of more effective decision- \nmaking by enabling humans to either make better or faster decisions. In contrast to knowledge creation systems, these ML-based \nsystems, which we named task augmentation systems, focus on more structured decisions that occur in higher frequency and vol -\nume. We found that task augmentation projects are mostly concerned with implementing ML-based systems into production envi -\nronments to augment human capabilities and support them in their everyday work tasks. Here, humans still remain the final decision \nmakers in the end, but they receive advice or instructions originating from a predictive or prescriptive ML model and optional decision \nfunction. Hence, the underlying value creation mechanism is to augment the limited information processing capabilities of humans \nwith the superhuman capabilities of ML, hence combining and leveraging human capabilities and ML resources for targeting more \neffective or efficient decision-making. \nWe identified two subtypes of the task augmentation mechanism: applications that leave high or low discretion for the human \ndecision maker (i.e., the user of the system). \nHigh-discretion task augmentation. These applications of ML support decision-making in ways that leave large parts of the final judg -\nment and choices to the discretion of their users. This is done, for example, by displaying a set of predictions or recommendations, from \nwhich the user can select one or decide to ignore them completely. The sales department of a pharmaceutical company, for example, \nhas enriched its customer relationship management (CRM) system with color-coded ratings that indicate the preferred communication \nchannel for office-based physicians. Leveraging these predictions, but also the experience and personal relationships of the sales \nagents, they can choose the most promising channel for contacting the client. Another example is a digital parking assistant, which one \nof our interviewees described as follows: “That’s ultimately a tool with a dashboard that shows how likely it is that a parking space will \nbe available. Then the drivers can decide whether they use the parking space or not.” (Translated, P34: Parking area demand forecast). \nLow-discretion task augmentation. These applications of ML allow users only little influence on the final decisions made. For example, \nan energy retailer implemented a task augmentation system in its call center, which dynamically instructs agents what questions to ask \nand in which order. The agents have little influence on how to conduct the conversation, as they continuously receive prescriptions by \nthe system on how to act and have only a few seconds to think about questions and answers. In the case of such low-discretion \naugmentation systems, the main role of the user is not to be a decision maker, but rather to be an actuator that can intervene and \noverrule the system when exceptions or anomalies occur. We found that tasks that are supported by such low-discretion systems could \nbe fully automated in theory (including implementation of the chosen actions), because users mostly follow the instructions of the \nsystem. However, in practice, the final decision remained with the human due to technical, ethical, legal, or risk-related concerns. \nIn contrast to high-discretion augmentation systems, which usually make predictions, low-discretion augmentation systems go one \nstep further and generate prescriptions. They do so through decision functions that perform automatic selection of a final and often \nmathematically optimal set of courses of actions out of several evaluated alternatives. Frequently, optimization algorithms (e.g., linear \nprogramming) or simple heuristics like “take the alternative with the highest score” are applied. For example, in the call center system \nmentioned earlier, the task augmentation system only instructs agents to ask questions about customer satisfaction at the end of a call, \nif the estimated churn probability for a given customer exceeds a certain threshold. Therefore, the call center agent has almost no \ndiscretion in this case. \nML value creation mechanism 3: Autonomous agent \nThe third ML value creation mechanism we identified was concerned with automation. The primary value target of the underlying \nprojects (14 of 56) was to use automation to either increase productivity, by substituting human labor through ML-based agents, or to \nenable new value propositions, by offering smarter products and services. In contrast to knowledge creation and augmentation sys -\ntems, autonomous agents make decisions and implement actions without a human in the loop (see right part of Fig. 5). In order to \nachieve this, they typically combine supervised ML models with decision functions to automatically choose a mathematically optimal \nsequence of actions. \nWe identified two subtypes of ML-based autonomous agents. ML can improve, on the one hand, the efficiency of (existing) business \nprocesses by reducing time and resources needed for process execution. We name these applications of ML process automation. On the \nother hand, ML can be an integral part of an intelligent—often called smart—product or service. We label these applications of ML as \nintelligent products and services. \nProcess automation. Here, the ML system executes internal business processes to make them more efficient. A representative example \nfor this type of application is the automated placement of advertisement banners at websites, operated by a multinational jewelry \nretailer we interviewed. In the past, external agencies or internal advertisement professionals decided which banner to place at which \nwebsite and when. Today, they have automated this process end-to-end; the ML system is provided with a budget to spend and not only \nA.

Fig. 5 gives an overview of the \ntechnical similarities and differences between the three ML value creation mechanisms. In all cases, we have an ML system that \noperates within an environment by collecting data from and returning information to that environment. \nThe value creation mechanisms differ in three main aspects: First, how tight this feedback loop is (from indirect to closed-loop); \nsecond, what kind of output the ML system generates (ranging from descriptions to prescriptions); and third, the division of labor \nbetween ML systems and human decision makers. The division of labor ranges from a clear focus on human agency in the case of the \nknowledge creation mechanism, to almost full algorithmic automation in the case of the autonomous agent mechanism. It also goes \nhand in hand with a varying amount of information processing through the ML system. \nIn the case of the knowledge creation mechanism, the ML system merely produces models which provide descriptions and ex -\nplanations for organizational knowing processes. Task augmentation systems, in contrast, are equipped with prediction and decision \nfunctions on top of models. These functions generate predictions or prescriptions, respectively. Moreover, autonomous agents go \nbeyond decision-making and actually perform—based on algorithmic prescriptions—real actions in the environment. Table 1 (on page \n27) provides a structured summary of further differentiating characteristics for the value creation mechanisms. More details are \navailable in the Tables A.3 and A.4 in the appendix, where we compiled an extensive listing of quotes from the interviews to further \nillustrate these mechanisms. \nML value creation mechanism 1: Knowledge creation \nThe first group of ML applications we identified pursued the value target of organizational knowledge creation. More specifically, \n24 of 56 applications we studied had the goal of supporting humans in discovering new knowledge by providing them with ML-based \ntools for inductively identifying trends and patterns in historical data (see left part of Fig. 5). These knowledge creation systems are not \nindependent agents. Rather, they are tools that are used by organizational decision makers—just as scientists use instruments like \nmicroscopes or telescopes in their research. We found that these systems often supported rather strategic decision-making processes (e. \ng., data-driven customer segmentation for market research, root-cause analysis for delivery shortages). We further found that these \napplications of ML rarely ended directly in the implementation of productive IT systems and instead focused on prototypes, or reports \nthat have a relatively low technical maturity, without interactive user interfaces. However, project execution was frequently inefficient \ndue to the ad-hoc nature of these projects and the fact that the analysis outputs were not used in a clearly defined downstream decision- \nmaking task, but rather mobilized as inputs for strategic decisions. Hence, these projects resembled more data-intensive research \nprojects than classical IT projects. They included one-time, typically ad-hoc, analyses of historical data to generate exploratory and \nexplanatory knowledge by modeling patterns and trends related to strategic decisions. Overall, we could observe a tendency to apply \ntransparent models instead of highly complex black box algorithms, as the goal of these projects was to explore relationships between \nvariables or to test hypotheses. Many interviewees described the objective of these projects as “identifying the drivers of the [data \ngenerating] process,” which then allow the creation of an understanding of existing phenomena and support the development of new \nconcepts and ideas. These projects typically create knowledge that describes or explains phenomena for whole (sub-)populations (e.g., \ncustomer groups) rather than predicting events on an individual level (e.g., a single customer). For example, describing a customer \nchurn analysis in the energy industry, one of our interviews explained: “In my opinion, what generates the most impact are the factors \nTable 1 \nAttributes of the ML value creation mechanisms.   \nKnowledge creation (ML \nvalue creation mechanism \n1) \nTask augmentation (ML value creation \nmechanism 2) \nAutonomous agents (ML value creation \nmechanism 3) \nSubtypes – Low- and high-discretion (decision-making) \ntasks \nProcess automation, Intelligent products and \nservices \nValue targets Organizational knowing More effective (faster or better) decision- \nmaking \nIncreased productivity, novel value offerings \nRequired capabilities and \nenvironmental factors \nStrong data science \ncapabilities, deep domain \nknowledge \nMature data infrastructure, strong DevOps, user \nexperience (UX) capabilities \nIntegration with transactional systems and \nprocesses, stable environment, few legal and \nethical constraints \nOutput Descriptions (patterns, trends) \nand explanations \n(tested hypotheses) \nPredictions (probabilities, scores, forecasts, \netc.) and prescriptions (recommendations, \ninstructions) \nPrescriptions (instructions) \nDeployed algorithms and \nmodels \nUnsupervised ML, causal \ninference, simulation \nSupervised ML and optimization Supervised ML and optimization \nDecision maker Human Human \n(at least in the loop) \nMachine \nAction taker Human Human or machine Machine \nLevel of decision-making Strategic and tactical Tactical and operational Operational  \nA.

We synthesized the empirical findings of our \nstudy into a process model of ML value creation (presented in Fig. 6 ), which we further discuss below. \nA process model of ML value creation \nOur process model highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the ML value creation and includes three main interrelated el -\nements: ML value creation mechanisms, necessary but not sufficient conditions, and the shifting practice. \nFirst, there are three different ML value creation mechanisms and five subtypes through which organizations can create value by \npursuing specific value targets. Common to the three mechanisms of ML value creation is that they represent distinct ways in which ML \napplications contribute — through new knowledge, predictions, prescriptions, actions, or new value offerings — to the pursuit of value \ntargets set by an organization. Therefore, our findings show that ML value creation mechanisms represent crucial elements in the ML \nvalue creation process ( Grover et al., 2018; Hedstr ¨om & Ylikoski, 2010 ). Each mechanism is executed by a different human-ML \nconfiguration, hence, it represents a different mode of delegation between humans and AI ( Baird & Maruping, 2021 ). Our results \nthereby underpin the discourse on how to leverage the broader set of AI technologies to increase task-technology-fit with an empir -\nically grounded set of ML technology uses ( Makasi et al., 2021; Vimalkumar et al., 2021 ). \nWhile the types and subtypes are not new per se, they do provide evidence that organizations employ them sequentially on a project \nlevel but simultaneously on a portfolio level to pursue different value targets from ML applications. Scholars have largely discussed the \nuse of AI for achieving value targets through augmentation and\/or automation mechanisms ( Gr ø nsund & Aanestad, 2020; Raisch & \nKrakowski, 2020 ). The ML value creation mechanism of knowledge creation has so far remained primarily detached from the \naugmentation and automation mechanisms (e.g., Berente et al., 2019; Tremblay et al., 2021 ). Yet, this new form of knowledge creation \nthrough ML-based models represents a new form of goal-setting for the use of ML in companies. \nSecond, for each mechanism, we found a set of necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to successfully \nleverage the ML value creation mechanisms. The conditions indicate necessary capabilities and environmental factors in which or -\nganizations can leverage the different ML value creation mechanisms. The presence of all necessary conditions does not guarantee that \na mechanism will produce the desired outcome (i.e., achieve the respective value target). But the absence of any necessary condition \nexplains that organizations cannot successfully leverage the ML value creation mechanism. While previous studies recognize and \nmention many resources and capabilities necessary for successful implementation of ML applications (e.g., Akkiraju et al., 2020; \nAmershi et al., 2019; Fountaine et al., 2019; Mikalef & Gupta, 2021; Tarafdar et al., 2019 ), these resources and capabilities together \nwith environmental factors have not yet been linked to specific ML value creation mechanisms. Without this integrated view, previous \nstudies attribute the high failure rate to organizational implementation and restructuring time lags ( Brynjolfsson et al., 2017 ). Hence, \nour process model provides an alternative explanation for high failure rate of ML projects and their poor business impact, as we \ndemonstrate that the mismatch between the necessary conditions and the targeted ML value creation mechanism does not allow \norganizations to successfully leverage the ML value creation mechanism. Furthermore, our process model shows that necessary \nconditions are inherited from left to right, i.e., augmentation inherits conditions from knowledge creation and the autonomous agent \nmechanism inherits from task augmentation. This means that a growing number of conditions need to be met to leverage a tighter \nintegration of ML into business processes ( Fountaine et al., 2019 ). This is in line with computer science studies ( Akkiraju et al., 2020; \nGarcia et al., 2018 ), which have also observed a correlation between automation and high maturity of ML applications. \nThird, we discovered that, in dynamic environments, where capabilities and environmental factors change, shifting between ML \nvalue creation mechanisms is necessary to achieve and sustain value. The identified reconfiguration trajectories underline that stra -\ntegic decisions about the ML value creation mechanisms are not static. Organizations have to constantly orchestrate their resources and \ncapabilities based on organizational and environmental conditions in order to sustain value creation from ML applications ( Markus, \n2017 ). Thus, organizations need to configure and reconfigure their ML applications continuously to match changing conditions, which \nreflects the ML value creation orchestration and the dynamic capability of managing ML applications ( Bo ˇzi ˇc & Dimovski, 2019; Daniel \net al., 2014; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2006; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2011; Zhang et al., 2021 ). As ML systems are different from other IT ap -\nplications ( Amershi et al., 2019 ), organizations need to develop new dynamic capabilities to sense changes in the environment, assess \ntheir impact on the ML effectiveness, and accordingly make necessary changes. It is especially crucial to monitor data generating \nprocesses, because the data generated today will become tomorrow ’ s training data and, thereby, alter future ML models, which, in \nturn, will influence future predictions, prescriptions, or even decisions. \nHaving identified ML project reconfigurations, our data suggests that the left to right reconfiguration trajectory (i.e., moving to -\nwards autonomous agents) is driven by managers as the “ desired evolution ” driven by the economic logic to automate processes \n( Zuboff, 1985 ). This indicates a tendency of business managers to have positive evaluations towards delegation to ML models. In these \nsituations, data scientists as operational managers seem to be the ones that understand the intricacies of delegation by making explicit \nboth the capabilities of the ML models and the conditions that need to be in place for leveraging the ML value creation mechanism and \nactively pursuing the value target. This trajectory shows deliberate, planned steps of managerial actions. As data infrastructures, data \nscience skills, DevOps and UX skills mature over time, or legal requirements change, new opportunities for resource orchestration \nemerge. These new opportunities are exploited by deliberately shifting the ML value creation mechanism and reconfiguring the \nhuman-ML configuration: i.e., delegating more and more to ML systems. \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 16: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n17\ntargets for ML projects. In particular, our Table 1 helps in selecting the most effective type of ML use based on the intended value \ncontribution (organizational knowing → Mechanism 1, more effective decision-making → Mechanisms 2a and 2b, increased pro -\nductivity \/ novel value offerings → Mechanisms 3a and 3b). Likewise, the architectures illustrated in Fig. 5 can act as blueprints for \ndesigning ML systems and their interactions with users and the environment (e.g., whether to implement an indirect or closed feedback \nloop, whether to automate decisions through ML or let the human decision makers have the final word). This clarity helps to avoid \nsituations where applications of ML are evaluated based on performance measures that do not apply to their specific types (e.g., the use \nof predictive accuracy for an interpretable model or the insistence on explainability without a need for it) or there are inconsistencies in \nthe division of labor between ML and human. Second, we underlined that ML applications can be based on diverse value creation \nmechanisms, focusing not only on automating or augmenting, but also on creating new knowledge. Firms should consider the complete \nbandwidth of value creation mechanisms to achieve the whole variety of value targets, for example by using ML in innovation or \nresearch and development processes. Third, knowing the identified conditions and the fact that reconfigurations are not only possible \nbut rather inevitable helps firms sustain value creation over time. Firms should also update their ML strategy based on this knowledge \nand allow for incremental improvements (e.g., start with experimental pilot projects in labs and integrate them into productive \nprocesses when technical infrastructures and processes are mature enough), and proactively shift the value creation mechanism when \nconditions are no longer met. To enable this shifting, managers should establish an iterative reflective process to allow for unforeseen \nreconfiguration of projects so that they continue to create value, even if the value target changes over time or different environmental \nfactors were anticipated. Fourth, the identified conditions inform executives, but also data scientists and ML project managers, about \npossible problems and mitigation approaches (e.g., what alternative paths for ML projects exist to sustain value creation when con -\nditions are not met anymore or when new opportunities arise). They also provide decision support for AI strategists and managers to \n(re-)adjust the ML value creation mechanisms adopted by projects, as well as the development steps that need to be undertaken for \nsustaining ML value by shifting value targets as conditions change. This is particularly important, as a change in conditions means that \nthe pursuit of a value target is at risk. \nConclusion \nOver the last years, IS and management scholars have repeatedly called for empirical research on the strategies that organizations \nemploy to pursue their organizational goals and create business value from AI (e.g., Coombs et al., 2020; Galliers et al., 2017; Markus, \n2017; Rai et al., 2019; Raisch & Krakowski, 2020; von Krogh, 2018). With this study, we contribute to research on the management of \nAI and specifically ML-based AI applications by proposing an empirically-grounded process model of ML value creation mechanisms, \nconditions, and reconfigurations. This process model explains the orchestration efforts of data scientists in leveraging diverse value \ncreation mechanisms in their effort to pursue value targets. Our findings assist in understanding why many organizations struggle with \nmanaging ML applications and leveraging them to meet their value targets. At the same time, the process model provides practical \nguidance for managers to navigate the largely uncharted waters of the ML value creation process. \nIn this study, we go as far as identifying ML value creation mechanisms and associated necessary conditions. Due to the explorative \nnature of this research, the identified ML value creation mechanisms are possibly not exhaustive. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the \nexact value that ML creates in these organizations. Explicitly, we do not capture the functional and symbolic impact these ML ap -\nplications have on organizational performance (Grover et al., 2018). Future studies, similar to those on the impact of big data analytics \non firm performance (Müller et al., 2018; Tambe, 2014; Wu et al., 2019), should add an economic point of view on the impact of ML \napplications in organizations. It would be also interesting to investigate if there is a correlation between the type, size, and digital (ML) \nmaturity of a company and the types of ML value creation mechanisms that they exploit. \nReflecting on our methodology, and as ML applications are being increasingly diffused in organizations, we acknowledge that \ninterviewing more stakeholders involved in ML application management and use (e.g., users, decision makers, strategists, business \ndomain experts), as well as gathering value-related artifacts (e.g., business cases, cost benefit analysis, benefit realization measures and \nreports) would provide a more holistic view while also unpacking the micropolitics of the ML value creation process. \nFurthermore, our study takes the perspective of data scientists which have emerged into operational as well as middle level \nmanagers and shows their orchestration efforts in pursuing organizational goals. While this is an important contribution of our study, \nsince most studies on the management of AI so far focus on top-level managers (Fountaine et al., 2019), it would be interesting to have \nstudies that investigate the synchronization efforts that span different managerial levels in organizations. \nIn our study, we also did not focus on the unintended consequences of ML applications (Newell & Marabelli, 2015)—an aspect that \nmight severely impact value creation while at the same time allow for broader conceptions of value (like societal value) to be taken into \naccount. Longitudinal case studies might provide richer insights into the unintended consequences of ML applications and their impact \non value creation. While our findings are a first step towards understanding the intricacies of ML value creation processes in orga -\nnizations, future studies could build on the limitations and provide additional contributions in this research area. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to \ninfluence the work reported in this paper. \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 15: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n16\nThe opposite trajectory from right to left (e.g. automation projects that shifted to another value creation mechanism because certain \nconditions were not met anymore) also indicates resource orchestration. Contrary to the left-to-right trajectory, the resource \norchestration is primarily driven by actions of data scientists in collaboration with domain experts. Data scientists — in this case acting \nas middle-level managers — seem to have the most knowledge about the limitations of ML systems. While ML systems have superhuman \ncapabilities in terms of speed and scale ( Lyytinen et al., 2020 ), they still remain limited as they have been designed to optimize an \nobjective function. In other words, today ’ s ML cannot set or modify their own goals ( Aleksander, 2017 ). When changes in the envi -\nronment occur, the competences of ML systems might be irrelevant, meaning that they might be fulfilling the wrong goals for the \ncurrent situation. Hence, changes in conditions (organizational or environmental) signal that the ML value creation mechanism cannot \nbe leveraged anymore. Therefore, data scientists engage in resource orchestration by sensing and identifying the changing conditions \nand changing the project scope to the adequate ML value creation mechanism. \nThese findings are in line with research on resource orchestration that points to the fact that different managerial levels are \ninvolved in the firm ’ s resource orchestration efforts ( Sirmon et al., 2011 ). For ML applications, top-level managers drive ML projects \ntowards more automation while data scientists are more aware of the actual conditions and can suggest alternative trajectories for \nprojects. \nFrom a computer science perspective, reconfiguration is key to realign ML with changes in humans ’ problem understanding and \nensure a high level of ML performance (e.g., Amershi et al., 2019; Sculley et al., 2015 ). From an organizational learning perspective, \nnot only do reconfigurations have a positive effect on organizational learning, but reconfiguration intensities also play a significant \nrole in establishing when “ ML contributions to organizational learning become valuable enough to produce actual gains in the or -\nganization ’ s knowledge ” ( Sturm et al., 2021 ). Our findings answer the so-far open question about when and how organizations should \nreconfigure their human-ML configurations from a resource orchestration perspective. We provide an explanation of why and when \nreconfigurations of human-ML arrangements happen and what trajectories these reconfigurations follow. \nTheoretical contributions \nOur process model contributes to the current literature on designing and implementing strategies in the context of ML systems in \nthree ways. First, as mentioned in the background section, most studies on ML or AI value creation in organizations are either con -\nceptual (e.g., Coombs et al., 2020; Davenport & Ronanki, 2018; Raisch & Krakowski, 2020 ) or pursue a variance perspective ( J ¨ohnk \net al., 2021; Mikalef & Gupta, 2021; Pumplun et al., 2019 ). This suggests lists of AI readiness factors (e.g., AI resources and capabilities \nthat organizations need) without, however, necessarily taking into account that these capabilities or environmental factors might \nchange over time. Our study contributes to this discourse by linking combinations of capabilities to ML value creation mechanisms and \nshowing that a change in these combinations (deliberate or not) triggers a change in the value creation mechanism that can be \nleveraged. We know that strategic actions that effectively bundle and leverage existing resources have performance-enhancing effects \n( Morrow Jr. et al., 2007 ). Our empirically grounded process model not only contributes by providing more nuance into the pursuit of \nML value creation through a set of ML value creation mechanisms but also explains how organizations engage in orchestration by \nshifting between ML value creation mechanisms as their capabilities evolve and business conditions change. \nSecond, by taking a process perspective on resource orchestration, we focus on the actors and the actions they take to leverage the \nadequate ML value creation mechanisms in dynamic environments. In this regard, our study contributes by highlighting the emerging \nrole of data scientists as orchestrators. Recent studies have also pointed to the increased role of data scientists in pursuing and creating \nvalue through ML applications ( Gr ø nsund & Aanestad, 2020; Joshi et al., 2021; Pachidi et al., 2021; Vaast & Pinsonneault, 2021; van \nden Broek et al., 2021 ). Adding to this growing body of work, our study illustrates how data scientists act as middle-level managers in \ncreating uniquely complementary resource bundles by integrating organizational capabilities, considering environmental factors, and \nshifting between ML value creation mechanisms in their pursuit of value creation through ML technologies. This shifting practice \nenables organizations to leverage AI-driven “ novel human – machine capabilities ” that complement traditional competitive capabilities \nin organizations with those of ML-based systems ( Krakowski et al., 2022 ). Our process model further extends the findings of Krakowski \net al. (2022) by contributing an integrated evolutionary view of how these novel human – machine capabilities can be built and \nleveraged in organizational settings. \nThird, on a broader scope, our process model also contributes to the IS and data-intensive value creation studies. In particular, we \nfurther unpack previous value creation process models ( Grover et al., 2018; Soh & Markus, 1995; Zeng & Glaister, 2018 ) and show \nconcrete relationships between capabilities and value creation mechanisms. This allows a deeper understanding of the transformation \nthat takes place from the capability building process into the capability realization process ( Grover et al., 2018 ). At the same time, \nthese previous process models focus on just identifying value creation mechanisms for IS and do not account for relationships between \nthe different mechanisms. Instead, the focus of our process model is the shifting between the value creation mechanisms. This dem -\nonstrates interaction between different value creation mechanisms, which lead to concrete orchestration paths through which orga -\nnizations pursue value creation. We believe that this novel perspective opens up a new direction for future research in the area of IS \nvalue creation process, considering links and interdependencies among different data-intensive value creation mechanisms. \nPractical implications \nOur research has four main implications for practitioners. First, the identified ML value creation mechanisms and conditions are \neffective management tools for the strategic positioning of ML initiatives. Both top-level managers (e.g., executives) and middle level \nmanagers (e.g., business managers or data scientists) can use the mechanisms and the conditions as guidance for formulating value \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 13: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n14\nIt is essential that autonomous systems are deployed in a sufficiently stable environment. One of the main issues that we observed \nwas that ML models were built under the assumption that the data generating process is stationary. However, changes to transactional \nsystems, business processes, or the organizational environment can change the underlying data generating process. For example, \nfrequent price changes in business-to-consumer settings are known to change consumers’ buying patterns and, hence, will have \nnegative consequences for the predictive accuracy of existing demand forecasting models. Such performance losses due to unstable \ndata generating processes can draw a whole project into question, as one interviewee reported that their system after months in \nproduction showed “a drift in the performance. And then [the stakeholder] didn’t trust us as much as after that.” (P32: Document matching \nnatural language processing). \nLastly, we observed that the success of autonomous agents can be dependent on the presence of ethical and legal constraints. While \nknowledge creation and augmentation systems always operate under human supervision (humans make final decisions and\/or take \nactions), autonomous agents do not have any humans in the loop when making procedural decisions. Hence, it is essential to design \nand monitor these systems carefully to ensure that they act within the ethical and legal boundaries. The CTO of an analytics vendor \ngave an example of a situation in which they did not want to automate a process fully due to legal and ethical concerns: \n“A client said recently: ‘It’s totally cool if you can automate this, but we will never do it, we always want to have a manual step in it… \nbecause then it’s not profiling … because of data protection, compliance … otherwise every customer has to be informed and [has to] \nagree.” (P01: Churn prediction). \nReconfiguration trajectories \nWe noticed that for some projects, the value creation mechanisms changed over time as conditions changed or opportunities to \nadvance to a more “mature” ML value mechanism emerged. We found seven ML applications in our sample in which such reconfi -\ngurations took place, and illustrate their trajectories schematically in Fig. 7. These trajectories suggest that a mismatch between a value \ncreation mechanism and its necessary conditions is the main reason for value not being realized. \nThe dominant trajectory of ML applications in our data is from left to right, i.e., from knowledge creation to augmentation, then, to \nautonomous agents. Our interviewees mentioned several reasons. First, it seems that managers generally associate ML applications \nwith automation. Our interviewees repeatedly reported that managers envisioned automated processes and had high expectations with \nregard to productivity gains. These inflated management expectations might support the tendency of ML projects to evolve towards \nautomation as more conditions are fulfilled. Many interviewees reported that they need to educate business people on what problems \ncan be solved with ML. One respondent explained: \n“Automation is actually one of the challenges [where we have] to manage expectations, because people think much of AI—Fantastic! But \nit is not really like that…. Models come with errors, you cannot do everything, and you must explain the limitations.” (P09: Automatic \nprocessing of health care policies). \nA reason why organizations did not start with automation projects right away, but rather tended to evolve their ML applications \nfrom “left to right” was risk management. Our interviewees referred to this evolution as a cautious approach to ML—which first \nimplements prototype applications, then tests them in the lab, and finally deploys them in the field. \nStarting with knowledge creation projects also allowed organizations to explore what ML can do for them, while providing rela -\ntively quick results. As the ML models became more stable (e.g., training data sets become more comprehensive), they could be further \nembedded in business processes and produce useful predictions for knowledge workers. If additional conditions were met and reliable \nresults had been produced, the ML application became more autonomous and the process automated. \nWe also observed trajectories from right to left, i.e., automation projects that shifted to another value creation mechanism because \ncertain conditions were not met anymore (see Vignette 2), or were never met from the start (see Vignette 1). In vignette 1, for example, \nthe utility company could not feed predictions from the model into their transactional systems (condition: integration with transactional \nsystems and processes). In vignette 2, the phenomenon under investigation (i.e., consumer behavior on the internet) was not stable \nanymore due to the Covid-19 pandemic and could not be modeled through ML (condition: stable environment). The project also changed \nscope by shifting to a different value creation mechanism and continued as a knowledge creation project before eventually evolving to \na task augmentation system. The company could quickly release a “Corona dashboard,” given that they met all conditions to shift to the \ntask augmentation value creation mechanism. Another situation we observed multiple times, which led to right-to-left reconfigura -\ntions was inflated management expectations. Managers often pushed for full automation of processes, even when the necessary \nconditions were not present. This led to scope changes during the project lifecycle or sometimes after the ML application had been \npoorly implemented and no value could have been realized. One interviewee, for instance, was working on a new automated pro -\nduction planning system to optimize logistics at a large pharmaceutical company. Eventually, the system could not go live as its ML \ncomponents lacked an interface to the existing planning systems, an issue that the technical team was well aware of. Management, \nhowever, seemed to expect a working fully automated ML solution, nonetheless (P29: Pharmaceutical company). \nTo enable reconfigurations, in general, a failure culture that allows organizations to put working prototypes into production, try \nthem out, and learn from failures, seems necessary. An interview partner from a startup stated: \n“You should not let yourself get demotivated by failures. It is not unusual to spend a month and a half gathering a dataset, then two weeks \npreparing the data, evaluating and analyzing it, and in the end, nothing comes out of it.” (P10: Publisher consulting) \nIn this section, we synthesized the empirical findings of our study into a process model of ML value creation (presented in Fig. 6). In \nthe next section, we discuss its theoretical and practical implications. \nA.

In particular, our Table 1 helps in selecting the most effective type of ML use based on the intended value \ncontribution (organizational knowing → Mechanism 1, more effective decision-making → Mechanisms 2a and 2b, increased pro -\nductivity \/ novel value offerings → Mechanisms 3a and 3b). Likewise, the architectures illustrated in Fig. 5 can act as blueprints for \ndesigning ML systems and their interactions with users and the environment (e.g., whether to implement an indirect or closed feedback \nloop, whether to automate decisions through ML or let the human decision makers have the final word). This clarity helps to avoid \nsituations where applications of ML are evaluated based on performance measures that do not apply to their specific types (e.g., the use \nof predictive accuracy for an interpretable model or the insistence on explainability without a need for it) or there are inconsistencies in \nthe division of labor between ML and human. Second, we underlined that ML applications can be based on diverse value creation \nmechanisms, focusing not only on automating or augmenting, but also on creating new knowledge. Firms should consider the complete \nbandwidth of value creation mechanisms to achieve the whole variety of value targets, for example by using ML in innovation or \nresearch and development processes. Third, knowing the identified conditions and the fact that reconfigurations are not only possible \nbut rather inevitable helps firms sustain value creation over time. Firms should also update their ML strategy based on this knowledge \nand allow for incremental improvements (e.g., start with experimental pilot projects in labs and integrate them into productive \nprocesses when technical infrastructures and processes are mature enough), and proactively shift the value creation mechanism when \nconditions are no longer met. To enable this shifting, managers should establish an iterative reflective process to allow for unforeseen \nreconfiguration of projects so that they continue to create value, even if the value target changes over time or different environmental \nfactors were anticipated. Fourth, the identified conditions inform executives, but also data scientists and ML project managers, about \npossible problems and mitigation approaches (e.g., what alternative paths for ML projects exist to sustain value creation when con -\nditions are not met anymore or when new opportunities arise). They also provide decision support for AI strategists and managers to \n(re-)adjust the ML value creation mechanisms adopted by projects, as well as the development steps that need to be undertaken for \nsustaining ML value by shifting value targets as conditions change. This is particularly important, as a change in conditions means that \nthe pursuit of a value target is at risk. \nConclusion \nOver the last years, IS and management scholars have repeatedly called for empirical research on the strategies that organizations \nemploy to pursue their organizational goals and create business value from AI (e.g., Coombs et al., 2020; Galliers et al., 2017; Markus, \n2017; Rai et al., 2019; Raisch & Krakowski, 2020; von Krogh, 2018). With this study, we contribute to research on the management of \nAI and specifically ML-based AI applications by proposing an empirically-grounded process model of ML value creation mechanisms, \nconditions, and reconfigurations. This process model explains the orchestration efforts of data scientists in leveraging diverse value \ncreation mechanisms in their effort to pursue value targets. Our findings assist in understanding why many organizations struggle with \nmanaging ML applications and leveraging them to meet their value targets. At the same time, the process model provides practical \nguidance for managers to navigate the largely uncharted waters of the ML value creation process. \nIn this study, we go as far as identifying ML value creation mechanisms and associated necessary conditions. Due to the explorative \nnature of this research, the identified ML value creation mechanisms are possibly not exhaustive. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the \nexact value that ML creates in these organizations. Explicitly, we do not capture the functional and symbolic impact these ML ap -\nplications have on organizational performance (Grover et al., 2018). Future studies, similar to those on the impact of big data analytics \non firm performance (Müller et al., 2018; Tambe, 2014; Wu et al., 2019), should add an economic point of view on the impact of ML \napplications in organizations. It would be also interesting to investigate if there is a correlation between the type, size, and digital (ML) \nmaturity of a company and the types of ML value creation mechanisms that they exploit. \nReflecting on our methodology, and as ML applications are being increasingly diffused in organizations, we acknowledge that \ninterviewing more stakeholders involved in ML application management and use (e.g., users, decision makers, strategists, business \ndomain experts), as well as gathering value-related artifacts (e.g., business cases, cost benefit analysis, benefit realization measures and \nreports) would provide a more holistic view while also unpacking the micropolitics of the ML value creation process. \nFurthermore, our study takes the perspective of data scientists which have emerged into operational as well as middle level \nmanagers and shows their orchestration efforts in pursuing organizational goals. While this is an important contribution of our study, \nsince most studies on the management of AI so far focus on top-level managers (Fountaine et al., 2019), it would be interesting to have \nstudies that investigate the synchronization efforts that span different managerial levels in organizations. \nIn our study, we also did not focus on the unintended consequences of ML applications (Newell & Marabelli, 2015)—an aspect that \nmight severely impact value creation while at the same time allow for broader conceptions of value (like societal value) to be taken into \naccount. Longitudinal case studies might provide richer insights into the unintended consequences of ML applications and their impact \non value creation. While our findings are a first step towards understanding the intricacies of ML value creation processes in orga -\nnizations, future studies could build on the limitations and provide additional contributions in this research area. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to \ninfluence the work reported in this paper. \nA.

We synthesized the empirical findings of our \nstudy into a process model of ML value creation (presented in Fig. 6 ), which we further discuss below. \nA process model of ML value creation \nOur process model highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the ML value creation and includes three main interrelated el -\nements: ML value creation mechanisms, necessary but not sufficient conditions, and the shifting practice. \nFirst, there are three different ML value creation mechanisms and five subtypes through which organizations can create value by \npursuing specific value targets. Common to the three mechanisms of ML value creation is that they represent distinct ways in which ML \napplications contribute — through new knowledge, predictions, prescriptions, actions, or new value offerings — to the pursuit of value \ntargets set by an organization. Therefore, our findings show that ML value creation mechanisms represent crucial elements in the ML \nvalue creation process ( Grover et al., 2018; Hedstr ¨om & Ylikoski, 2010 ). Each mechanism is executed by a different human-ML \nconfiguration, hence, it represents a different mode of delegation between humans and AI ( Baird & Maruping, 2021 ). Our results \nthereby underpin the discourse on how to leverage the broader set of AI technologies to increase task-technology-fit with an empir -\nically grounded set of ML technology uses ( Makasi et al., 2021; Vimalkumar et al., 2021 ). \nWhile the types and subtypes are not new per se, they do provide evidence that organizations employ them sequentially on a project \nlevel but simultaneously on a portfolio level to pursue different value targets from ML applications. Scholars have largely discussed the \nuse of AI for achieving value targets through augmentation and\/or automation mechanisms ( Gr ø nsund & Aanestad, 2020; Raisch & \nKrakowski, 2020 ). The ML value creation mechanism of knowledge creation has so far remained primarily detached from the \naugmentation and automation mechanisms (e.g., Berente et al., 2019; Tremblay et al., 2021 ). Yet, this new form of knowledge creation \nthrough ML-based models represents a new form of goal-setting for the use of ML in companies. \nSecond, for each mechanism, we found a set of necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to successfully \nleverage the ML value creation mechanisms. The conditions indicate necessary capabilities and environmental factors in which or -\nganizations can leverage the different ML value creation mechanisms. The presence of all necessary conditions does not guarantee that \na mechanism will produce the desired outcome (i.e., achieve the respective value target). But the absence of any necessary condition \nexplains that organizations cannot successfully leverage the ML value creation mechanism. While previous studies recognize and \nmention many resources and capabilities necessary for successful implementation of ML applications (e.g., Akkiraju et al., 2020; \nAmershi et al., 2019; Fountaine et al., 2019; Mikalef & Gupta, 2021; Tarafdar et al., 2019 ), these resources and capabilities together \nwith environmental factors have not yet been linked to specific ML value creation mechanisms. Without this integrated view, previous \nstudies attribute the high failure rate to organizational implementation and restructuring time lags ( Brynjolfsson et al., 2017 ). Hence, \nour process model provides an alternative explanation for high failure rate of ML projects and their poor business impact, as we \ndemonstrate that the mismatch between the necessary conditions and the targeted ML value creation mechanism does not allow \norganizations to successfully leverage the ML value creation mechanism. Furthermore, our process model shows that necessary \nconditions are inherited from left to right, i.e., augmentation inherits conditions from knowledge creation and the autonomous agent \nmechanism inherits from task augmentation. This means that a growing number of conditions need to be met to leverage a tighter \nintegration of ML into business processes ( Fountaine et al., 2019 ). This is in line with computer science studies ( Akkiraju et al., 2020; \nGarcia et al., 2018 ), which have also observed a correlation between automation and high maturity of ML applications. \nThird, we discovered that, in dynamic environments, where capabilities and environmental factors change, shifting between ML \nvalue creation mechanisms is necessary to achieve and sustain value. The identified reconfiguration trajectories underline that stra -\ntegic decisions about the ML value creation mechanisms are not static. Organizations have to constantly orchestrate their resources and \ncapabilities based on organizational and environmental conditions in order to sustain value creation from ML applications ( Markus, \n2017 ). Thus, organizations need to configure and reconfigure their ML applications continuously to match changing conditions, which \nreflects the ML value creation orchestration and the dynamic capability of managing ML applications ( Bo ˇzi ˇc & Dimovski, 2019; Daniel \net al., 2014; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2006; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2011; Zhang et al., 2021 ). As ML systems are different from other IT ap -\nplications ( Amershi et al., 2019 ), organizations need to develop new dynamic capabilities to sense changes in the environment, assess \ntheir impact on the ML effectiveness, and accordingly make necessary changes. It is especially crucial to monitor data generating \nprocesses, because the data generated today will become tomorrow ’ s training data and, thereby, alter future ML models, which, in \nturn, will influence future predictions, prescriptions, or even decisions. \nHaving identified ML project reconfigurations, our data suggests that the left to right reconfiguration trajectory (i.e., moving to -\nwards autonomous agents) is driven by managers as the “ desired evolution ” driven by the economic logic to automate processes \n( Zuboff, 1985 ). This indicates a tendency of business managers to have positive evaluations towards delegation to ML models. In these \nsituations, data scientists as operational managers seem to be the ones that understand the intricacies of delegation by making explicit \nboth the capabilities of the ML models and the conditions that need to be in place for leveraging the ML value creation mechanism and \nactively pursuing the value target. This trajectory shows deliberate, planned steps of managerial actions. As data infrastructures, data \nscience skills, DevOps and UX skills mature over time, or legal requirements change, new opportunities for resource orchestration \nemerge. These new opportunities are exploited by deliberately shifting the ML value creation mechanism and reconfiguring the \nhuman-ML configuration: i.e., delegating more and more to ML systems. \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 1: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n2\nalready points to a need for organizations to understand how to structure AI and other resources, bundle them into capabilities, and \nultimately capitalize on these capabilities. \nResearch at the organizational level supports this proposition. Companies seem to struggle with realizing and sustaining value from \nAI initiatives (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Tarafdar et al., 2019). Many companies run only ad-hoc projects without developing \norganization-wide AI strategies or apply AI in just a single business process (Fountaine et al., 2019). Others go directly for “moonshot” \nprojects (i.e., ambitious, exploratory, and ground-breaking endeavors) without any expectation of near-term profitability and without \nsystematically evaluating where AI would create the most value (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). \nBoth academic and practitioner-oriented discourses focus on the possibilities that AI offers (Coombs et al., 2020; Davenport & \nRonanki, 2018; Shrestha et al., 2019), but fall short of uncovering the mechanisms that may produce the promised outcomes. So far, \nthe academic discussion on AI value creation mechanisms centers around the choice between AI augmentation versus AI automation, \notherwise known as the support-versus-replace debate (see Markus, 2017; Zuboff, 1985). Yet, we are currently lacking empirical \nresearch that analyzes how organizations decide about the level of augmentation\/automation (Coombs et al., 2020), what kind of \nvalue organizations try to generate with AI (Lyytinen et al., 2020), and what organizational strategies they employ to pursue value \nfrom AI (Berente et al., 2021; Günther et al., 2017). We address the calls from both information systems (IS) (Coombs et al., 2020; \nGalliers et al., 2017; Markus, 2017; Rai et al., 2019) and management scholars (Raisch & Krakowski, 2020; von Krogh, 2018) to study \nhow organizations pursue their value targets through AI applications. \nFrom a technology perspective, there are two approaches to developing AI systems (Berente et al., 2021): the rule-based approach, \nalso known as symbolic AI; and the machine learning (ML) approach, also known as the connectionist approach (Chollet, 2019; Legg & \nHutter, 2007). While the rule-based approach played an important role in the early days of AI, since the resurgence of ML in the 1990s \nand the rise of deep learning in the 2010s, the learning approach is increasingly becoming the dominant approach to building AI \nsystems (Berente et al., 2021; Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). Therefore, in our study, we focus on the applications of ML and examine the \nmechanisms firms employ in trying to reach their value targets. Our work draws on theoretical foundations of the business value of \ndata-intensive practices, especially big data analytics (BDA). More specifically, we use the research framework of Grover et al. (2018) \non “value creation by big data analytics” and insights from resource orchestration literature as sensitizing devices. The framework \nhighlights the importance of value creation mechanisms in the process of translating investments in IT infrastructure into business \nvalue. Value creation mechanisms represent “different ways to create value” (Grover et al. 2018, p. 400) using a technology and \n“indicate the fundamental source of value being pursued” (p. 401). In other words, value creation mechanisms describe the way to \nreach certain organizational goals (e.g., product and service innovation, business process improvement); whether this goal will \neventually be reached (i.e., measurable business value is created) depends on several additional factors (e.g., the overall economic \nsituation, competition in the industry, changing customer needs). Against this background, we investigate the following research \nquestion: \nWhat are the value creation mechanisms that organizations employ to pursue their value targets through ML applications? \nTo answer the above research question, we carried out an exploratory interview study focusing on 56 applications of ML in 29 \norganizations. Our findings show that there are three different ML value creation mechanisms (with five subtypes) that organizations \ncan employ to pursue their value targets. Each ML value creation mechanism represents a unique and fundamental source of value that \norganizations pursue. Next to that, we found that organizations sometimes shift from one value creation mechanism to another, within \nthe same project, by rearranging their human-ML configurations. Finally, we identified necessary but not sufficient conditions for \nemploying the different value creation mechanisms that provide explanations for the current high failure rate of ML projects. Based on \nthese findings, we synthesize a process model of ML value creation, which illustrates how organizations engage in (resource) \norchestration by shifting between ML value creation mechanisms as their capabilities evolve and\/or business conditions change. In this \nrespect, our study contributes to the current literature on designing and implementing strategies in the context of ML systems by \nlinking capabilities, managerial action, and value creation mechanisms in dynamic organizational environments. Furthermore, our \nfindings contribute to data-intensive work studies showing the critical role of data scientists in orchestration activities, as they pursue \ncreating and sustaining value through ML applications. \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: First, we provide the background of our study. Next, we present our research \nmethod, followed by the presentation and discussion of our findings. We conclude by summarizing the study’s limitations and \ncontributions. \nBackground \nAs the objective of this study is to identify value creation mechanisms that explain how organizations can reach their value targets \nwith ML, rather than any digital technology, we focus our literature review on how ML applications can be used for pursuing orga -\nnizational goals. In doing this, we first summarize the characteristics of ML technology and how it is currently used in organizational \nsettings. Next, we unpack the notion of mechanisms, what it means to identify value creation mechanisms in organizations, and how \nthey are grounded in the resource-based view of the firm—more specifically, in the idea of resource orchestration. \nML technology and its organizational uses \nAdvances in ML technology have revitalized interest in AI research. Recent breakthroughs in the field of ML (e.g., deep neural \nnetworks) have been driven by dramatic increases in the availability of digital data and computing resources (Dean et al., 2018). \nIndeed, the effective use of ML would not be possible without foundational data-intensive technologies such as big data analytics \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 4: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n5\n2018), such as “democratize data,” “contextualize data,” “experiment with data,” and “execute data insights.” Yet, as we have argued \nearlier, because BDA pursues a different organizational goal than ML, one cannot simply generalize or transfer BDA value creation \nmechanisms to the context of ML. Hence, identifying ML-specific value creation mechanisms promises to allow new insights into how \nML resources and capabilities are combined to achieve respective value targets. \nMotivated by the practical need to understand the mechanisms of ML value creation mechanisms in organizations and given the \naforementioned theoretical gap, our study empirically explores the mechanisms of how organizations pursue their value targets \nthrough ML. Viewing ML value creation mechanisms through a resource orchestration lens means looking for ways that resources and \ncapabilities are bundled, mobilized, configured, and reconfigured into ML applications in order to pursue specific value targets. We \nexplicate boundary conditions and managerial decision options for value creation mechanisms. We illustrate the goal of our study \nwithin the existing theoretical framing in Fig. 1. \nMethod \nWe chose an exploratory and qualitative research design in which we conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with data scientists \nand managers who are involved in the development of ML applications. Below, we describe our study design, data collection, and \nanalysis in detail. \nStudy design \nFollowing the framework of Grover et al. (2018), we pursued a process perspective to investigate ML value creation in organi -\nzations and thoroughly examine the value creation mechanisms that are existent in organizations. For that, we selected to interview 40 \ndata scientists of which seven had grown to a managerial position from a data science background (they are data science team leads or \nC-level representatives of small to medium-sized data analytics and ML service providers; most of them have a PhD). As indicated in the \nliterature review, data scientists take over many managerial activities and decisions when it comes to ML applications. For example, \nthey have “a role that demands more responsibility and a deeper sense of accountability” than statisticians or pure technical employees \n(Vaast & Pinsonneault, 2021, p. 1095), they decide over the inclusion and exclusion of domain experts in ML model development (van \nden Broek et al., 2021), and they switch between roles of augmenting and altering ML models (Grønsund & Aanestad, 2020). Based on \ntheir involvement in managerial activities, we view data scientists as active pursuers of ML value targets and key actors in leveraging \nthe ML value creation mechanisms, and therefore a strong foundation for our study. The hybrid technical and business nature of their \nprofession and their involvement throughout the lifecycle (Hummer et al., 2019) of ML projects gives them a holistic view on ML and \nits application in organizations (Davenport & Patil, 2012; Plastino & Purdy, 2018; van der Aalst, 2014) and makes them critical in -\nformants of how organizations achieve value targets through ML applications. By interviewing them, we gained an inside, bottom-up \nview into how ML applications are leveraged to pursue value targets (Plastino & Purdy, 2018)—a view we believe is lacking currently \nin the IS literature. Following Gioia (2013), we treated these “informants” as “knowledgeable agents,” giving them an “extraordinary \nvoice” (p. 26). Practically, this meant that we assumed that our informants “know what they are trying to do and can explain their \nthoughts, intentions, and actions” (Gioia et al., 2013, p. 17). \nData collection \nWe collected our empirical data between October 2018 and March 2020. In this period, we interviewed 40 data scientists from 29 \ncompanies about their involvement in 56 corporate applications of ML (ongoing projects and deployed systems). \nSampling strategy \nIn exploring the breadth and depth of the phenomenon, we followed a maximum variation strategy for purposeful sampling, which \nhelped us to capture and describe mechanisms of ML value creation that cut across a great deal of variation (Patton, 2002, p. 234f). The \norganizations for which the interview partners worked covered six large (above 1,000 employees), sixteen medium-sized (between 15 \nand 1,000 employees), and seven small companies (below 15 employees). The companies belonged to a variety of industries (e.g., \nretailing, mechanical engineering, energy, banking and finance, robotics, IT consulting, data analytics vendors, transportation, media, \npharma, foods and beverages, public sector). They were located mainly in Germany and Denmark, but also in other European \ncountries, the U.S., and Singapore. Fourteen of them were operating globally. The interview partners had between several months to up \nto seven years of job experience in their current position. Some 21% of our interview partners were female. We provide full lists of the \ninterviews and analyzed projects—together with descriptive information on the interviews, the investigated projects, and the com -\npanies—in the appendix (projects in Table A.1 and interviews in Table A.2). \nWe continued to conduct interviews until we found a point of redundancy in the mechanisms identified and further data collection \ndid not add any new mechanisms (Corbin & Strauss, 2015; Lincoln & Guba, 1986, p. 203; Patton, 2002, p. 246). This manifested in our \nobservation that the identified types of ML value creation (and subtypes, see next section) did not change in the last quarter of in -\nterviews of our study. \nStructure and contents of the interviews \nThe retrospective accounts of our interviewees constituted the main data source for our research and theorizing process. The in -\nterviews followed an interview guide that we flexibly adjusted over time, driven by the accounts of the informants (Gioia et al., 2013) \nA.

Companies seem to struggle with realizing and sustaining value from \nAI initiatives (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Tarafdar et al., 2019). Many companies run only ad-hoc projects without developing \norganization-wide AI strategies or apply AI in just a single business process (Fountaine et al., 2019). Others go directly for “moonshot” \nprojects (i.e., ambitious, exploratory, and ground-breaking endeavors) without any expectation of near-term profitability and without \nsystematically evaluating where AI would create the most value (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). \nBoth academic and practitioner-oriented discourses focus on the possibilities that AI offers (Coombs et al., 2020; Davenport & \nRonanki, 2018; Shrestha et al., 2019), but fall short of uncovering the mechanisms that may produce the promised outcomes. So far, \nthe academic discussion on AI value creation mechanisms centers around the choice between AI augmentation versus AI automation, \notherwise known as the support-versus-replace debate (see Markus, 2017; Zuboff, 1985). Yet, we are currently lacking empirical \nresearch that analyzes how organizations decide about the level of augmentation\/automation (Coombs et al., 2020), what kind of \nvalue organizations try to generate with AI (Lyytinen et al., 2020), and what organizational strategies they employ to pursue value \nfrom AI (Berente et al., 2021; Günther et al., 2017). We address the calls from both information systems (IS) (Coombs et al., 2020; \nGalliers et al., 2017; Markus, 2017; Rai et al., 2019) and management scholars (Raisch & Krakowski, 2020; von Krogh, 2018) to study \nhow organizations pursue their value targets through AI applications. \nFrom a technology perspective, there are two approaches to developing AI systems (Berente et al., 2021): the rule-based approach, \nalso known as symbolic AI; and the machine learning (ML) approach, also known as the connectionist approach (Chollet, 2019; Legg & \nHutter, 2007). While the rule-based approach played an important role in the early days of AI, since the resurgence of ML in the 1990s \nand the rise of deep learning in the 2010s, the learning approach is increasingly becoming the dominant approach to building AI \nsystems (Berente et al., 2021; Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). Therefore, in our study, we focus on the applications of ML and examine the \nmechanisms firms employ in trying to reach their value targets. Our work draws on theoretical foundations of the business value of \ndata-intensive practices, especially big data analytics (BDA). More specifically, we use the research framework of Grover et al. (2018) \non “value creation by big data analytics” and insights from resource orchestration literature as sensitizing devices. The framework \nhighlights the importance of value creation mechanisms in the process of translating investments in IT infrastructure into business \nvalue. Value creation mechanisms represent “different ways to create value” (Grover et al. 2018, p. 400) using a technology and \n“indicate the fundamental source of value being pursued” (p. 401). In other words, value creation mechanisms describe the way to \nreach certain organizational goals (e.g., product and service innovation, business process improvement); whether this goal will \neventually be reached (i.e., measurable business value is created) depends on several additional factors (e.g., the overall economic \nsituation, competition in the industry, changing customer needs). Against this background, we investigate the following research \nquestion: \nWhat are the value creation mechanisms that organizations employ to pursue their value targets through ML applications? \nTo answer the above research question, we carried out an exploratory interview study focusing on 56 applications of ML in 29 \norganizations. Our findings show that there are three different ML value creation mechanisms (with five subtypes) that organizations \ncan employ to pursue their value targets. Each ML value creation mechanism represents a unique and fundamental source of value that \norganizations pursue. Next to that, we found that organizations sometimes shift from one value creation mechanism to another, within \nthe same project, by rearranging their human-ML configurations. Finally, we identified necessary but not sufficient conditions for \nemploying the different value creation mechanisms that provide explanations for the current high failure rate of ML projects. Based on \nthese findings, we synthesize a process model of ML value creation, which illustrates how organizations engage in (resource) \norchestration by shifting between ML value creation mechanisms as their capabilities evolve and\/or business conditions change. In this \nrespect, our study contributes to the current literature on designing and implementing strategies in the context of ML systems by \nlinking capabilities, managerial action, and value creation mechanisms in dynamic organizational environments. Furthermore, our \nfindings contribute to data-intensive work studies showing the critical role of data scientists in orchestration activities, as they pursue \ncreating and sustaining value through ML applications. \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: First, we provide the background of our study. Next, we present our research \nmethod, followed by the presentation and discussion of our findings. We conclude by summarizing the study’s limitations and \ncontributions. \nBackground \nAs the objective of this study is to identify value creation mechanisms that explain how organizations can reach their value targets \nwith ML, rather than any digital technology, we focus our literature review on how ML applications can be used for pursuing orga -\nnizational goals. In doing this, we first summarize the characteristics of ML technology and how it is currently used in organizational \nsettings. Next, we unpack the notion of mechanisms, what it means to identify value creation mechanisms in organizations, and how \nthey are grounded in the resource-based view of the firm—more specifically, in the idea of resource orchestration. \nML technology and its organizational uses \nAdvances in ML technology have revitalized interest in AI research. Recent breakthroughs in the field of ML (e.g., deep neural \nnetworks) have been driven by dramatic increases in the availability of digital data and computing resources (Dean et al., 2018). \nIndeed, the effective use of ML would not be possible without foundational data-intensive technologies such as big data analytics \nA.

Reasons include managers associating ML applications with automation, high expectations regarding productivity gains, and a need to educate business people on what ML can solve.  A cautious approach, starting with prototypes and testing, also contributes.","reference_context":"Document 13: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n14\nIt is essential that autonomous systems are deployed in a sufficiently stable environment. One of the main issues that we observed \nwas that ML models were built under the assumption that the data generating process is stationary. However, changes to transactional \nsystems, business processes, or the organizational environment can change the underlying data generating process. For example, \nfrequent price changes in business-to-consumer settings are known to change consumers’ buying patterns and, hence, will have \nnegative consequences for the predictive accuracy of existing demand forecasting models. Such performance losses due to unstable \ndata generating processes can draw a whole project into question, as one interviewee reported that their system after months in \nproduction showed “a drift in the performance. And then [the stakeholder] didn’t trust us as much as after that.” (P32: Document matching \nnatural language processing). \nLastly, we observed that the success of autonomous agents can be dependent on the presence of ethical and legal constraints. While \nknowledge creation and augmentation systems always operate under human supervision (humans make final decisions and\/or take \nactions), autonomous agents do not have any humans in the loop when making procedural decisions. Hence, it is essential to design \nand monitor these systems carefully to ensure that they act within the ethical and legal boundaries. The CTO of an analytics vendor \ngave an example of a situation in which they did not want to automate a process fully due to legal and ethical concerns: \n“A client said recently: ‘It’s totally cool if you can automate this, but we will never do it, we always want to have a manual step in it… \nbecause then it’s not profiling … because of data protection, compliance … otherwise every customer has to be informed and [has to] \nagree.” (P01: Churn prediction). \nReconfiguration trajectories \nWe noticed that for some projects, the value creation mechanisms changed over time as conditions changed or opportunities to \nadvance to a more “mature” ML value mechanism emerged. We found seven ML applications in our sample in which such reconfi -\ngurations took place, and illustrate their trajectories schematically in Fig. 7. These trajectories suggest that a mismatch between a value \ncreation mechanism and its necessary conditions is the main reason for value not being realized. \nThe dominant trajectory of ML applications in our data is from left to right, i.e., from knowledge creation to augmentation, then, to \nautonomous agents. Our interviewees mentioned several reasons. First, it seems that managers generally associate ML applications \nwith automation. Our interviewees repeatedly reported that managers envisioned automated processes and had high expectations with \nregard to productivity gains. These inflated management expectations might support the tendency of ML projects to evolve towards \nautomation as more conditions are fulfilled. Many interviewees reported that they need to educate business people on what problems \ncan be solved with ML. One respondent explained: \n“Automation is actually one of the challenges [where we have] to manage expectations, because people think much of AI—Fantastic! But \nit is not really like that…. Models come with errors, you cannot do everything, and you must explain the limitations.” (P09: Automatic \nprocessing of health care policies). \nA reason why organizations did not start with automation projects right away, but rather tended to evolve their ML applications \nfrom “left to right” was risk management. Our interviewees referred to this evolution as a cautious approach to ML—which first \nimplements prototype applications, then tests them in the lab, and finally deploys them in the field. \nStarting with knowledge creation projects also allowed organizations to explore what ML can do for them, while providing rela -\ntively quick results. As the ML models became more stable (e.g., training data sets become more comprehensive), they could be further \nembedded in business processes and produce useful predictions for knowledge workers. If additional conditions were met and reliable \nresults had been produced, the ML application became more autonomous and the process automated. \nWe also observed trajectories from right to left, i.e., automation projects that shifted to another value creation mechanism because \ncertain conditions were not met anymore (see Vignette 2), or were never met from the start (see Vignette 1). In vignette 1, for example, \nthe utility company could not feed predictions from the model into their transactional systems (condition: integration with transactional \nsystems and processes). In vignette 2, the phenomenon under investigation (i.e., consumer behavior on the internet) was not stable \nanymore due to the Covid-19 pandemic and could not be modeled through ML (condition: stable environment). The project also changed \nscope by shifting to a different value creation mechanism and continued as a knowledge creation project before eventually evolving to \na task augmentation system. The company could quickly release a “Corona dashboard,” given that they met all conditions to shift to the \ntask augmentation value creation mechanism. Another situation we observed multiple times, which led to right-to-left reconfigura -\ntions was inflated management expectations. Managers often pushed for full automation of processes, even when the necessary \nconditions were not present. This led to scope changes during the project lifecycle or sometimes after the ML application had been \npoorly implemented and no value could have been realized. One interviewee, for instance, was working on a new automated pro -\nduction planning system to optimize logistics at a large pharmaceutical company. Eventually, the system could not go live as its ML \ncomponents lacked an interface to the existing planning systems, an issue that the technical team was well aware of. Management, \nhowever, seemed to expect a working fully automated ML solution, nonetheless (P29: Pharmaceutical company). \nTo enable reconfigurations, in general, a failure culture that allows organizations to put working prototypes into production, try \nthem out, and learn from failures, seems necessary. An interview partner from a startup stated: \n“You should not let yourself get demotivated by failures. It is not unusual to spend a month and a half gathering a dataset, then two weeks \npreparing the data, evaluating and analyzing it, and in the end, nothing comes out of it.” (P10: Publisher consulting) \nIn this section, we synthesized the empirical findings of our study into a process model of ML value creation (presented in Fig. 6). In \nthe next section, we discuss its theoretical and practical implications. \nA.

We synthesized the empirical findings of our \nstudy into a process model of ML value creation (presented in Fig. 6 ), which we further discuss below. \nA process model of ML value creation \nOur process model highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the ML value creation and includes three main interrelated el -\nements: ML value creation mechanisms, necessary but not sufficient conditions, and the shifting practice. \nFirst, there are three different ML value creation mechanisms and five subtypes through which organizations can create value by \npursuing specific value targets. Common to the three mechanisms of ML value creation is that they represent distinct ways in which ML \napplications contribute — through new knowledge, predictions, prescriptions, actions, or new value offerings — to the pursuit of value \ntargets set by an organization. Therefore, our findings show that ML value creation mechanisms represent crucial elements in the ML \nvalue creation process ( Grover et al., 2018; Hedstr ¨om & Ylikoski, 2010 ). Each mechanism is executed by a different human-ML \nconfiguration, hence, it represents a different mode of delegation between humans and AI ( Baird & Maruping, 2021 ). Our results \nthereby underpin the discourse on how to leverage the broader set of AI technologies to increase task-technology-fit with an empir -\nically grounded set of ML technology uses ( Makasi et al., 2021; Vimalkumar et al., 2021 ). \nWhile the types and subtypes are not new per se, they do provide evidence that organizations employ them sequentially on a project \nlevel but simultaneously on a portfolio level to pursue different value targets from ML applications. Scholars have largely discussed the \nuse of AI for achieving value targets through augmentation and\/or automation mechanisms ( Gr ø nsund & Aanestad, 2020; Raisch & \nKrakowski, 2020 ). The ML value creation mechanism of knowledge creation has so far remained primarily detached from the \naugmentation and automation mechanisms (e.g., Berente et al., 2019; Tremblay et al., 2021 ). Yet, this new form of knowledge creation \nthrough ML-based models represents a new form of goal-setting for the use of ML in companies. \nSecond, for each mechanism, we found a set of necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to successfully \nleverage the ML value creation mechanisms. The conditions indicate necessary capabilities and environmental factors in which or -\nganizations can leverage the different ML value creation mechanisms. The presence of all necessary conditions does not guarantee that \na mechanism will produce the desired outcome (i.e., achieve the respective value target). But the absence of any necessary condition \nexplains that organizations cannot successfully leverage the ML value creation mechanism. While previous studies recognize and \nmention many resources and capabilities necessary for successful implementation of ML applications (e.g., Akkiraju et al., 2020; \nAmershi et al., 2019; Fountaine et al., 2019; Mikalef & Gupta, 2021; Tarafdar et al., 2019 ), these resources and capabilities together \nwith environmental factors have not yet been linked to specific ML value creation mechanisms. Without this integrated view, previous \nstudies attribute the high failure rate to organizational implementation and restructuring time lags ( Brynjolfsson et al., 2017 ). Hence, \nour process model provides an alternative explanation for high failure rate of ML projects and their poor business impact, as we \ndemonstrate that the mismatch between the necessary conditions and the targeted ML value creation mechanism does not allow \norganizations to successfully leverage the ML value creation mechanism. Furthermore, our process model shows that necessary \nconditions are inherited from left to right, i.e., augmentation inherits conditions from knowledge creation and the autonomous agent \nmechanism inherits from task augmentation. This means that a growing number of conditions need to be met to leverage a tighter \nintegration of ML into business processes ( Fountaine et al., 2019 ). This is in line with computer science studies ( Akkiraju et al., 2020; \nGarcia et al., 2018 ), which have also observed a correlation between automation and high maturity of ML applications. \nThird, we discovered that, in dynamic environments, where capabilities and environmental factors change, shifting between ML \nvalue creation mechanisms is necessary to achieve and sustain value. The identified reconfiguration trajectories underline that stra -\ntegic decisions about the ML value creation mechanisms are not static. Organizations have to constantly orchestrate their resources and \ncapabilities based on organizational and environmental conditions in order to sustain value creation from ML applications ( Markus, \n2017 ). Thus, organizations need to configure and reconfigure their ML applications continuously to match changing conditions, which \nreflects the ML value creation orchestration and the dynamic capability of managing ML applications ( Bo ˇzi ˇc & Dimovski, 2019; Daniel \net al., 2014; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2006; Pavlou & El Sawy, 2011; Zhang et al., 2021 ). As ML systems are different from other IT ap -\nplications ( Amershi et al., 2019 ), organizations need to develop new dynamic capabilities to sense changes in the environment, assess \ntheir impact on the ML effectiveness, and accordingly make necessary changes. It is especially crucial to monitor data generating \nprocesses, because the data generated today will become tomorrow ’ s training data and, thereby, alter future ML models, which, in \nturn, will influence future predictions, prescriptions, or even decisions. \nHaving identified ML project reconfigurations, our data suggests that the left to right reconfiguration trajectory (i.e., moving to -\nwards autonomous agents) is driven by managers as the “ desired evolution ” driven by the economic logic to automate processes \n( Zuboff, 1985 ). This indicates a tendency of business managers to have positive evaluations towards delegation to ML models. In these \nsituations, data scientists as operational managers seem to be the ones that understand the intricacies of delegation by making explicit \nboth the capabilities of the ML models and the conditions that need to be in place for leveraging the ML value creation mechanism and \nactively pursuing the value target. This trajectory shows deliberate, planned steps of managerial actions. As data infrastructures, data \nscience skills, DevOps and UX skills mature over time, or legal requirements change, new opportunities for resource orchestration \nemerge. These new opportunities are exploited by deliberately shifting the ML value creation mechanism and reconfiguring the \nhuman-ML configuration: i.e., delegating more and more to ML systems. \nA.

Fig. 5 gives an overview of the \ntechnical similarities and differences between the three ML value creation mechanisms. In all cases, we have an ML system that \noperates within an environment by collecting data from and returning information to that environment. \nThe value creation mechanisms differ in three main aspects: First, how tight this feedback loop is (from indirect to closed-loop); \nsecond, what kind of output the ML system generates (ranging from descriptions to prescriptions); and third, the division of labor \nbetween ML systems and human decision makers. The division of labor ranges from a clear focus on human agency in the case of the \nknowledge creation mechanism, to almost full algorithmic automation in the case of the autonomous agent mechanism. It also goes \nhand in hand with a varying amount of information processing through the ML system. \nIn the case of the knowledge creation mechanism, the ML system merely produces models which provide descriptions and ex -\nplanations for organizational knowing processes. Task augmentation systems, in contrast, are equipped with prediction and decision \nfunctions on top of models. These functions generate predictions or prescriptions, respectively. Moreover, autonomous agents go \nbeyond decision-making and actually perform—based on algorithmic prescriptions—real actions in the environment. Table 1 (on page \n27) provides a structured summary of further differentiating characteristics for the value creation mechanisms. More details are \navailable in the Tables A.3 and A.4 in the appendix, where we compiled an extensive listing of quotes from the interviews to further \nillustrate these mechanisms. \nML value creation mechanism 1: Knowledge creation \nThe first group of ML applications we identified pursued the value target of organizational knowledge creation. More specifically, \n24 of 56 applications we studied had the goal of supporting humans in discovering new knowledge by providing them with ML-based \ntools for inductively identifying trends and patterns in historical data (see left part of Fig. 5). These knowledge creation systems are not \nindependent agents. Rather, they are tools that are used by organizational decision makers—just as scientists use instruments like \nmicroscopes or telescopes in their research. We found that these systems often supported rather strategic decision-making processes (e. \ng., data-driven customer segmentation for market research, root-cause analysis for delivery shortages). We further found that these \napplications of ML rarely ended directly in the implementation of productive IT systems and instead focused on prototypes, or reports \nthat have a relatively low technical maturity, without interactive user interfaces. However, project execution was frequently inefficient \ndue to the ad-hoc nature of these projects and the fact that the analysis outputs were not used in a clearly defined downstream decision- \nmaking task, but rather mobilized as inputs for strategic decisions. Hence, these projects resembled more data-intensive research \nprojects than classical IT projects. They included one-time, typically ad-hoc, analyses of historical data to generate exploratory and \nexplanatory knowledge by modeling patterns and trends related to strategic decisions. Overall, we could observe a tendency to apply \ntransparent models instead of highly complex black box algorithms, as the goal of these projects was to explore relationships between \nvariables or to test hypotheses. Many interviewees described the objective of these projects as “identifying the drivers of the [data \ngenerating] process,” which then allow the creation of an understanding of existing phenomena and support the development of new \nconcepts and ideas. These projects typically create knowledge that describes or explains phenomena for whole (sub-)populations (e.g., \ncustomer groups) rather than predicting events on an individual level (e.g., a single customer). For example, describing a customer \nchurn analysis in the energy industry, one of our interviews explained: “In my opinion, what generates the most impact are the factors \nTable 1 \nAttributes of the ML value creation mechanisms.   \nKnowledge creation (ML \nvalue creation mechanism \n1) \nTask augmentation (ML value creation \nmechanism 2) \nAutonomous agents (ML value creation \nmechanism 3) \nSubtypes – Low- and high-discretion (decision-making) \ntasks \nProcess automation, Intelligent products and \nservices \nValue targets Organizational knowing More effective (faster or better) decision- \nmaking \nIncreased productivity, novel value offerings \nRequired capabilities and \nenvironmental factors \nStrong data science \ncapabilities, deep domain \nknowledge \nMature data infrastructure, strong DevOps, user \nexperience (UX) capabilities \nIntegration with transactional systems and \nprocesses, stable environment, few legal and \nethical constraints \nOutput Descriptions (patterns, trends) \nand explanations \n(tested hypotheses) \nPredictions (probabilities, scores, forecasts, \netc.) and prescriptions (recommendations, \ninstructions) \nPrescriptions (instructions) \nDeployed algorithms and \nmodels \nUnsupervised ML, causal \ninference, simulation \nSupervised ML and optimization Supervised ML and optimization \nDecision maker Human Human \n(at least in the loop) \nMachine \nAction taker Human Human or machine Machine \nLevel of decision-making Strategic and tactical Tactical and operational Operational  \nA.

They serve as a basis for discussion in the company about how one might \ndevelop new concepts.” (Translated; P03: Customer churn modeling). Such data-driven discoveries are usually represented as pa -\nrameters of a statistical model that, for example, explains customer churn. In the above-mentioned project, for instance, a pattern was \nidentified that for a one-unit increase in customer spending, the likelihood that customer churn decreases by a certain percentage \npoint. \nML value creation mechanism 2: Task augmentation \nThe second group of ML applications we identified (18 of 56 applications) pursued the value target of more effective decision- \nmaking by enabling humans to either make better or faster decisions. In contrast to knowledge creation systems, these ML-based \nsystems, which we named task augmentation systems, focus on more structured decisions that occur in higher frequency and vol -\nume. We found that task augmentation projects are mostly concerned with implementing ML-based systems into production envi -\nronments to augment human capabilities and support them in their everyday work tasks. Here, humans still remain the final decision \nmakers in the end, but they receive advice or instructions originating from a predictive or prescriptive ML model and optional decision \nfunction. Hence, the underlying value creation mechanism is to augment the limited information processing capabilities of humans \nwith the superhuman capabilities of ML, hence combining and leveraging human capabilities and ML resources for targeting more \neffective or efficient decision-making. \nWe identified two subtypes of the task augmentation mechanism: applications that leave high or low discretion for the human \ndecision maker (i.e., the user of the system). \nHigh-discretion task augmentation. These applications of ML support decision-making in ways that leave large parts of the final judg -\nment and choices to the discretion of their users. This is done, for example, by displaying a set of predictions or recommendations, from \nwhich the user can select one or decide to ignore them completely. The sales department of a pharmaceutical company, for example, \nhas enriched its customer relationship management (CRM) system with color-coded ratings that indicate the preferred communication \nchannel for office-based physicians. Leveraging these predictions, but also the experience and personal relationships of the sales \nagents, they can choose the most promising channel for contacting the client. Another example is a digital parking assistant, which one \nof our interviewees described as follows: “That’s ultimately a tool with a dashboard that shows how likely it is that a parking space will \nbe available. Then the drivers can decide whether they use the parking space or not.” (Translated, P34: Parking area demand forecast). \nLow-discretion task augmentation. These applications of ML allow users only little influence on the final decisions made. For example, \nan energy retailer implemented a task augmentation system in its call center, which dynamically instructs agents what questions to ask \nand in which order. The agents have little influence on how to conduct the conversation, as they continuously receive prescriptions by \nthe system on how to act and have only a few seconds to think about questions and answers. In the case of such low-discretion \naugmentation systems, the main role of the user is not to be a decision maker, but rather to be an actuator that can intervene and \noverrule the system when exceptions or anomalies occur. We found that tasks that are supported by such low-discretion systems could \nbe fully automated in theory (including implementation of the chosen actions), because users mostly follow the instructions of the \nsystem. However, in practice, the final decision remained with the human due to technical, ethical, legal, or risk-related concerns. \nIn contrast to high-discretion augmentation systems, which usually make predictions, low-discretion augmentation systems go one \nstep further and generate prescriptions. They do so through decision functions that perform automatic selection of a final and often \nmathematically optimal set of courses of actions out of several evaluated alternatives. Frequently, optimization algorithms (e.g., linear \nprogramming) or simple heuristics like “take the alternative with the highest score” are applied. For example, in the call center system \nmentioned earlier, the task augmentation system only instructs agents to ask questions about customer satisfaction at the end of a call, \nif the estimated churn probability for a given customer exceeds a certain threshold. Therefore, the call center agent has almost no \ndiscretion in this case. \nML value creation mechanism 3: Autonomous agent \nThe third ML value creation mechanism we identified was concerned with automation. The primary value target of the underlying \nprojects (14 of 56) was to use automation to either increase productivity, by substituting human labor through ML-based agents, or to \nenable new value propositions, by offering smarter products and services. In contrast to knowledge creation and augmentation sys -\ntems, autonomous agents make decisions and implement actions without a human in the loop (see right part of Fig. 5). In order to \nachieve this, they typically combine supervised ML models with decision functions to automatically choose a mathematically optimal \nsequence of actions. \nWe identified two subtypes of ML-based autonomous agents. ML can improve, on the one hand, the efficiency of (existing) business \nprocesses by reducing time and resources needed for process execution. We name these applications of ML process automation. On the \nother hand, ML can be an integral part of an intelligent—often called smart—product or service. We label these applications of ML as \nintelligent products and services. \nProcess automation. Here, the ML system executes internal business processes to make them more efficient. A representative example \nfor this type of application is the automated placement of advertisement banners at websites, operated by a multinational jewelry \nretailer we interviewed. In the past, external agencies or internal advertisement professionals decided which banner to place at which \nwebsite and when. Today, they have automated this process end-to-end; the ML system is provided with a budget to spend and not only \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 16: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n17\ntargets for ML projects. In particular, our Table 1 helps in selecting the most effective type of ML use based on the intended value \ncontribution (organizational knowing → Mechanism 1, more effective decision-making → Mechanisms 2a and 2b, increased pro -\nductivity \/ novel value offerings → Mechanisms 3a and 3b). Likewise, the architectures illustrated in Fig. 5 can act as blueprints for \ndesigning ML systems and their interactions with users and the environment (e.g., whether to implement an indirect or closed feedback \nloop, whether to automate decisions through ML or let the human decision makers have the final word). This clarity helps to avoid \nsituations where applications of ML are evaluated based on performance measures that do not apply to their specific types (e.g., the use \nof predictive accuracy for an interpretable model or the insistence on explainability without a need for it) or there are inconsistencies in \nthe division of labor between ML and human. Second, we underlined that ML applications can be based on diverse value creation \nmechanisms, focusing not only on automating or augmenting, but also on creating new knowledge. Firms should consider the complete \nbandwidth of value creation mechanisms to achieve the whole variety of value targets, for example by using ML in innovation or \nresearch and development processes. Third, knowing the identified conditions and the fact that reconfigurations are not only possible \nbut rather inevitable helps firms sustain value creation over time. Firms should also update their ML strategy based on this knowledge \nand allow for incremental improvements (e.g., start with experimental pilot projects in labs and integrate them into productive \nprocesses when technical infrastructures and processes are mature enough), and proactively shift the value creation mechanism when \nconditions are no longer met. To enable this shifting, managers should establish an iterative reflective process to allow for unforeseen \nreconfiguration of projects so that they continue to create value, even if the value target changes over time or different environmental \nfactors were anticipated. Fourth, the identified conditions inform executives, but also data scientists and ML project managers, about \npossible problems and mitigation approaches (e.g., what alternative paths for ML projects exist to sustain value creation when con -\nditions are not met anymore or when new opportunities arise). They also provide decision support for AI strategists and managers to \n(re-)adjust the ML value creation mechanisms adopted by projects, as well as the development steps that need to be undertaken for \nsustaining ML value by shifting value targets as conditions change. This is particularly important, as a change in conditions means that \nthe pursuit of a value target is at risk. \nConclusion \nOver the last years, IS and management scholars have repeatedly called for empirical research on the strategies that organizations \nemploy to pursue their organizational goals and create business value from AI (e.g., Coombs et al., 2020; Galliers et al., 2017; Markus, \n2017; Rai et al., 2019; Raisch & Krakowski, 2020; von Krogh, 2018). With this study, we contribute to research on the management of \nAI and specifically ML-based AI applications by proposing an empirically-grounded process model of ML value creation mechanisms, \nconditions, and reconfigurations. This process model explains the orchestration efforts of data scientists in leveraging diverse value \ncreation mechanisms in their effort to pursue value targets. Our findings assist in understanding why many organizations struggle with \nmanaging ML applications and leveraging them to meet their value targets. At the same time, the process model provides practical \nguidance for managers to navigate the largely uncharted waters of the ML value creation process. \nIn this study, we go as far as identifying ML value creation mechanisms and associated necessary conditions. Due to the explorative \nnature of this research, the identified ML value creation mechanisms are possibly not exhaustive. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the \nexact value that ML creates in these organizations. Explicitly, we do not capture the functional and symbolic impact these ML ap -\nplications have on organizational performance (Grover et al., 2018). Future studies, similar to those on the impact of big data analytics \non firm performance (Müller et al., 2018; Tambe, 2014; Wu et al., 2019), should add an economic point of view on the impact of ML \napplications in organizations. It would be also interesting to investigate if there is a correlation between the type, size, and digital (ML) \nmaturity of a company and the types of ML value creation mechanisms that they exploit. \nReflecting on our methodology, and as ML applications are being increasingly diffused in organizations, we acknowledge that \ninterviewing more stakeholders involved in ML application management and use (e.g., users, decision makers, strategists, business \ndomain experts), as well as gathering value-related artifacts (e.g., business cases, cost benefit analysis, benefit realization measures and \nreports) would provide a more holistic view while also unpacking the micropolitics of the ML value creation process. \nFurthermore, our study takes the perspective of data scientists which have emerged into operational as well as middle level \nmanagers and shows their orchestration efforts in pursuing organizational goals. While this is an important contribution of our study, \nsince most studies on the management of AI so far focus on top-level managers (Fountaine et al., 2019), it would be interesting to have \nstudies that investigate the synchronization efforts that span different managerial levels in organizations. \nIn our study, we also did not focus on the unintended consequences of ML applications (Newell & Marabelli, 2015)—an aspect that \nmight severely impact value creation while at the same time allow for broader conceptions of value (like societal value) to be taken into \naccount. Longitudinal case studies might provide richer insights into the unintended consequences of ML applications and their impact \non value creation. While our findings are a first step towards understanding the intricacies of ML value creation processes in orga -\nnizations, future studies could build on the limitations and provide additional contributions in this research area. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to \ninfluence the work reported in this paper. \nA.

Companies seem to struggle with realizing and sustaining value from \nAI initiatives (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Tarafdar et al., 2019). Many companies run only ad-hoc projects without developing \norganization-wide AI strategies or apply AI in just a single business process (Fountaine et al., 2019). Others go directly for “moonshot” \nprojects (i.e., ambitious, exploratory, and ground-breaking endeavors) without any expectation of near-term profitability and without \nsystematically evaluating where AI would create the most value (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). \nBoth academic and practitioner-oriented discourses focus on the possibilities that AI offers (Coombs et al., 2020; Davenport & \nRonanki, 2018; Shrestha et al., 2019), but fall short of uncovering the mechanisms that may produce the promised outcomes. So far, \nthe academic discussion on AI value creation mechanisms centers around the choice between AI augmentation versus AI automation, \notherwise known as the support-versus-replace debate (see Markus, 2017; Zuboff, 1985). Yet, we are currently lacking empirical \nresearch that analyzes how organizations decide about the level of augmentation\/automation (Coombs et al., 2020), what kind of \nvalue organizations try to generate with AI (Lyytinen et al., 2020), and what organizational strategies they employ to pursue value \nfrom AI (Berente et al., 2021; Günther et al., 2017). We address the calls from both information systems (IS) (Coombs et al., 2020; \nGalliers et al., 2017; Markus, 2017; Rai et al., 2019) and management scholars (Raisch & Krakowski, 2020; von Krogh, 2018) to study \nhow organizations pursue their value targets through AI applications. \nFrom a technology perspective, there are two approaches to developing AI systems (Berente et al., 2021): the rule-based approach, \nalso known as symbolic AI; and the machine learning (ML) approach, also known as the connectionist approach (Chollet, 2019; Legg & \nHutter, 2007). While the rule-based approach played an important role in the early days of AI, since the resurgence of ML in the 1990s \nand the rise of deep learning in the 2010s, the learning approach is increasingly becoming the dominant approach to building AI \nsystems (Berente et al., 2021; Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). Therefore, in our study, we focus on the applications of ML and examine the \nmechanisms firms employ in trying to reach their value targets. Our work draws on theoretical foundations of the business value of \ndata-intensive practices, especially big data analytics (BDA). More specifically, we use the research framework of Grover et al. (2018) \non “value creation by big data analytics” and insights from resource orchestration literature as sensitizing devices. The framework \nhighlights the importance of value creation mechanisms in the process of translating investments in IT infrastructure into business \nvalue. Value creation mechanisms represent “different ways to create value” (Grover et al. 2018, p. 400) using a technology and \n“indicate the fundamental source of value being pursued” (p. 401). In other words, value creation mechanisms describe the way to \nreach certain organizational goals (e.g., product and service innovation, business process improvement); whether this goal will \neventually be reached (i.e., measurable business value is created) depends on several additional factors (e.g., the overall economic \nsituation, competition in the industry, changing customer needs). Against this background, we investigate the following research \nquestion: \nWhat are the value creation mechanisms that organizations employ to pursue their value targets through ML applications? \nTo answer the above research question, we carried out an exploratory interview study focusing on 56 applications of ML in 29 \norganizations. Our findings show that there are three different ML value creation mechanisms (with five subtypes) that organizations \ncan employ to pursue their value targets. Each ML value creation mechanism represents a unique and fundamental source of value that \norganizations pursue. Next to that, we found that organizations sometimes shift from one value creation mechanism to another, within \nthe same project, by rearranging their human-ML configurations. Finally, we identified necessary but not sufficient conditions for \nemploying the different value creation mechanisms that provide explanations for the current high failure rate of ML projects. Based on \nthese findings, we synthesize a process model of ML value creation, which illustrates how organizations engage in (resource) \norchestration by shifting between ML value creation mechanisms as their capabilities evolve and\/or business conditions change. In this \nrespect, our study contributes to the current literature on designing and implementing strategies in the context of ML systems by \nlinking capabilities, managerial action, and value creation mechanisms in dynamic organizational environments. Furthermore, our \nfindings contribute to data-intensive work studies showing the critical role of data scientists in orchestration activities, as they pursue \ncreating and sustaining value through ML applications. \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: First, we provide the background of our study. Next, we present our research \nmethod, followed by the presentation and discussion of our findings. We conclude by summarizing the study’s limitations and \ncontributions. \nBackground \nAs the objective of this study is to identify value creation mechanisms that explain how organizations can reach their value targets \nwith ML, rather than any digital technology, we focus our literature review on how ML applications can be used for pursuing orga -\nnizational goals.

They also provide decision support for AI strategists and managers to \n(re-)adjust the ML value creation mechanisms adopted by projects, as well as the development steps that need to be undertaken for \nsustaining ML value by shifting value targets as conditions change. This is particularly important, as a change in conditions means that \nthe pursuit of a value target is at risk. \nConclusion \nOver the last years, IS and management scholars have repeatedly called for empirical research on the strategies that organizations \nemploy to pursue their organizational goals and create business value from AI (e.g., Coombs et al., 2020; Galliers et al., 2017; Markus, \n2017; Rai et al., 2019; Raisch & Krakowski, 2020; von Krogh, 2018). With this study, we contribute to research on the management of \nAI and specifically ML-based AI applications by proposing an empirically-grounded process model of ML value creation mechanisms, \nconditions, and reconfigurations. This process model explains the orchestration efforts of data scientists in leveraging diverse value \ncreation mechanisms in their effort to pursue value targets. Our findings assist in understanding why many organizations struggle with \nmanaging ML applications and leveraging them to meet their value targets. At the same time, the process model provides practical \nguidance for managers to navigate the largely uncharted waters of the ML value creation process. \nIn this study, we go as far as identifying ML value creation mechanisms and associated necessary conditions. Due to the explorative \nnature of this research, the identified ML value creation mechanisms are possibly not exhaustive. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the \nexact value that ML creates in these organizations. Explicitly, we do not capture the functional and symbolic impact these ML ap -\nplications have on organizational performance (Grover et al., 2018). Future studies, similar to those on the impact of big data analytics \non firm performance (Müller et al., 2018; Tambe, 2014; Wu et al., 2019), should add an economic point of view on the impact of ML \napplications in organizations. It would be also interesting to investigate if there is a correlation between the type, size, and digital (ML) \nmaturity of a company and the types of ML value creation mechanisms that they exploit. \nReflecting on our methodology, and as ML applications are being increasingly diffused in organizations, we acknowledge that \ninterviewing more stakeholders involved in ML application management and use (e.g., users, decision makers, strategists, business \ndomain experts), as well as gathering value-related artifacts (e.g., business cases, cost benefit analysis, benefit realization measures and \nreports) would provide a more holistic view while also unpacking the micropolitics of the ML value creation process. \nFurthermore, our study takes the perspective of data scientists which have emerged into operational as well as middle level \nmanagers and shows their orchestration efforts in pursuing organizational goals. While this is an important contribution of our study, \nsince most studies on the management of AI so far focus on top-level managers (Fountaine et al., 2019), it would be interesting to have \nstudies that investigate the synchronization efforts that span different managerial levels in organizations. \nIn our study, we also did not focus on the unintended consequences of ML applications (Newell & Marabelli, 2015)—an aspect that \nmight severely impact value creation while at the same time allow for broader conceptions of value (like societal value) to be taken into \naccount. Longitudinal case studies might provide richer insights into the unintended consequences of ML applications and their impact \non value creation. While our findings are a first step towards understanding the intricacies of ML value creation processes in orga -\nnizations, future studies could build on the limitations and provide additional contributions in this research area. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to \ninfluence the work reported in this paper. \nA.

Yet, ML and BDA are distinct phenomena with essential conceptual differences. BDA stands in a long tradition of technologies\n1\n, \nall of which were meant to “ informate ” ( Zuboff, 1985 ); that is, to provide decision makers with relevant information ( Abbasi et al., \n2016; Debortoli et al., 2014; Grover et al., 2018; Kitchin & McArdle, 2016; Müller et al., 2018 ). The vision of the field of ML, on the \nother hand, is to develop intelligent machines that are able to learn how to perform complex cognitive tasks without being explicitly \nprogrammed to do so ( Samuel, 1959 ). This vision goes beyond mere decision support; instead, it highlights the ambition to create \nartificial agents that are able to automate cognitive tasks which were formerly reserved for humans, and learn how to do this better \nover time ( Rai et al., 2019; Schuetz & Venkatesh, 2020; Sturm et al., 2021 ). Currently, we are still far away from this vision. The \nlearning capacity of today ’ s ML systems is limited to finding ways to optimize an objective function defined by its designer; in other \nwords, today ’ s ML systems cannot set or modify their own learning goals ( Aleksander, 2017 ). So, while ML and BDA are related \ntechnologies (e.g., ML uses the data provided by BDA), there are important differences in how these technologies contribute to \norganizational goals (i.e., informate human decision makers vs. automate cognitive tasks). \nIn fact, seen as a new generation of IS that can learn and act autonomously, ML-based AI systems constitute a new form of agency \n( Å gerfalk, 2020 ). Following this notion, several scholars have drawn up new research agendas to understand the implications of AI and \nunderlying technologies for individuals, businesses, and societies ( Å gerfalk, 2020; Baird & Maruping, 2021; Coombs et al., 2020; \nLyytinen et al., 2020; Schuetz & Venkatesh, 2020 ). Regarding the value contribution of ML applications in organizations, we identify \nthree main streams of research. \nThe first stream covers conceptual work around the automation possibilities of AI technologies, including ML ( Acemoglu & \nRestrepo, 2021; Agrawal et al., 2018; Coombs et al., 2020; Makridakis, 2017; Tarafdar et al., 2019 ). In these studies, in line with the \neconomic logic, the contribution of AI to organizational goals is often associated with automation ( Zuboff, 1985 ). \nIn parallel to the rather technology-oriented view of AI as an automation technology, a second research stream has evolved that \nhighlights the use of AI and ML-based applications for augmentation purposes (i.e., ameliorate — instead of substitute — human work \nwith AI). This research focuses on the organizational embedding of ML technology and expands on the effective combination of \nhuman-ML configurations ( Baird & Maruping, 2021; Gr ø nsund & Aanestad, 2020; Shrestha et al., 2019; van den Broek et al., 2021 ). \nCombining these first two views suggests that the value contribution of ML applications in organizations is not as black and white as \noften portrayed. Hence, organizations need to engage in applications of ML that both augment and automate human capabilities in \norder to “ achieve complementarities that benefit business and society ” ( Raisch & Krakowski, 2020, p. 192 ). This requires that or -\nganizations continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to sustain these comple -\nmentarities ( Gr ø nsund & Aanestad, 2020; Günther et al., 2017; Lebovitz et al., 2021; Markus, 2017; van den Broek et al., 2021 ). In \nrelation to these complementarities, researchers have started to develop and explore concepts such AI readiness and AI capability \n( J ¨ohnk et al., 2021; Mikalef & Gupta, 2021; Pumplun et al., 2019 ) to characterize organizational abilities to deploy and use AI in ways \nthat add value. These studies, however, are either on a conceptual level describing and defining these new notions or they are variance \nstudies that provide evidence for, or quantify, AI capability ’ s impact on organizational performance. These are important steps in \nunderstanding if and what are the AI readiness factors and AI resources that enable organizations to create business value. Yet, we still \nlack an understanding of the different ways organizations bundle, mobilize, configure, and reconfigure these AI resources and ca -\npabilities into AI applications in order to pursue organizational objectives. \nFinally, a third debate has emerged on the actors that manage ML scoping, development, and deployment in organizations. While \nmanagers are acknowledged and expected to “ make all key decisions about AI ” ( Berente et al., 2021, p . 1434), they also face a variety \nof new challenges, many of which are of a technical nature ( Berente et al., 2021 ). As managers struggle with understanding AI \ntechnologies and how they work ( Davenport & Ronanki, 2018; Li et al., 2021 ), data scientists appear to take a more prominent role as \nagents of change. Organizational field studies on human-ML configurations provide evidence of the important role data scientists play \nnot only in setting up ML models but also in many managerial activities in ML projects ( Gr ø nsund & Aanestad, 2020; Pachidi et al., \n2021; van den Broek et al., 2021 ). It appears that “ the role of the data scientist is to be the value creator — the bridge between stat -\nistician\/computer engineer\/etc. and key decision makers ’’ ( Vaast & Pinsonneault, 2021, p . 1095). As such, they have emerged as key \nactors in leveraging ML applications for organizational value creation (see Joshi et al. (2021) for examples). \nValue creation mechanisms and the resource orchestration view \nFrom a managerial perspective, ML technology is a new technology that organizations can employ to achieve organizational goals. \nThat is, ML technology enables new value creation mechanisms through which organizations can pursue their organizational goals. \nFollowing this, we continue our review with unpacking the notion of value creation mechanisms and their grounding in the resource \norchestration perspective of the resource-based view of the firm. \nAccording to Anderson et al. (2006), a focus on organizational mechanisms enables one to “ move beyond thinking about individual \nvariables and the specific links between them to considering the bigger picture of action in its entirety ” (p. 103). This means that the \nimportant elements of organizations are not the components (e.g., resources and capabilities) themselves, but rather the cogs and gears \nthat enable the translation from moving one component into the movement of another component. Specifically, as Hernes (1998) \npoints out, mechanisms are about “ the wheelwork or agency by which an effect is produced. In this way, mechanisms do not merely \naddress what happened, but also how it happened ” (p. 74). Mechanisms, however, do not apply or always work no matter what. There \n1 \nFrom the emergence of the first decision support systems in the 1960s to the wide-spread diffusion of enterprise-wide business intelligence \nplatforms in the 1990s, later continued to business intelligence & Analytics (see Chen et al., 2012 for a historical overview). \nA. Shollo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nDocument 4: Journal of Strategic Information Systems 31 (2022) 101734\n5\n2018), such as “democratize data,” “contextualize data,” “experiment with data,” and “execute data insights.” Yet, as we have argued \nearlier, because BDA pursues a different organizational goal than ML, one cannot simply generalize or transfer BDA value creation \nmechanisms to the context of ML. Hence, identifying ML-specific value creation mechanisms promises to allow new insights into how \nML resources and capabilities are combined to achieve respective value targets. \nMotivated by the practical need to understand the mechanisms of ML value creation mechanisms in organizations and given the \naforementioned theoretical gap, our study empirically explores the mechanisms of how organizations pursue their value targets \nthrough ML. Viewing ML value creation mechanisms through a resource orchestration lens means looking for ways that resources and \ncapabilities are bundled, mobilized, configured, and reconfigured into ML applications in order to pursue specific value targets. We \nexplicate boundary conditions and managerial decision options for value creation mechanisms. We illustrate the goal of our study \nwithin the existing theoretical framing in Fig. 1. \nMethod \nWe chose an exploratory and qualitative research design in which we conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with data scientists \nand managers who are involved in the development of ML applications. Below, we describe our study design, data collection, and \nanalysis in detail. \nStudy design \nFollowing the framework of Grover et al. (2018), we pursued a process perspective to investigate ML value creation in organi -\nzations and thoroughly examine the value creation mechanisms that are existent in organizations. For that, we selected to interview 40 \ndata scientists of which seven had grown to a managerial position from a data science background (they are data science team leads or \nC-level representatives of small to medium-sized data analytics and ML service providers; most of them have a PhD). As indicated in the \nliterature review, data scientists take over many managerial activities and decisions when it comes to ML applications. For example, \nthey have “a role that demands more responsibility and a deeper sense of accountability” than statisticians or pure technical employees \n(Vaast & Pinsonneault, 2021, p. 1095), they decide over the inclusion and exclusion of domain experts in ML model development (van \nden Broek et al., 2021), and they switch between roles of augmenting and altering ML models (Grønsund & Aanestad, 2020). Based on \ntheir involvement in managerial activities, we view data scientists as active pursuers of ML value targets and key actors in leveraging \nthe ML value creation mechanisms, and therefore a strong foundation for our study. The hybrid technical and business nature of their \nprofession and their involvement throughout the lifecycle (Hummer et al., 2019) of ML projects gives them a holistic view on ML and \nits application in organizations (Davenport & Patil, 2012; Plastino & Purdy, 2018; van der Aalst, 2014) and makes them critical in -\nformants of how organizations achieve value targets through ML applications. By interviewing them, we gained an inside, bottom-up \nview into how ML applications are leveraged to pursue value targets (Plastino & Purdy, 2018)—a view we believe is lacking currently \nin the IS literature. Following Gioia (2013), we treated these “informants” as “knowledgeable agents,” giving them an “extraordinary \nvoice” (p. 26). Practically, this meant that we assumed that our informants “know what they are trying to do and can explain their \nthoughts, intentions, and actions” (Gioia et al., 2013, p. 17). \nData collection \nWe collected our empirical data between October 2018 and March 2020. In this period, we interviewed 40 data scientists from 29 \ncompanies about their involvement in 56 corporate applications of ML (ongoing projects and deployed systems). \nSampling strategy \nIn exploring the breadth and depth of the phenomenon, we followed a maximum variation strategy for purposeful sampling, which \nhelped us to capture and describe mechanisms of ML value creation that cut across a great deal of variation (Patton, 2002, p. 234f). The \norganizations for which the interview partners worked covered six large (above 1,000 employees), sixteen medium-sized (between 15 \nand 1,000 employees), and seven small companies (below 15 employees). The companies belonged to a variety of industries (e.g., \nretailing, mechanical engineering, energy, banking and finance, robotics, IT consulting, data analytics vendors, transportation, media, \npharma, foods and beverages, public sector). They were located mainly in Germany and Denmark, but also in other European \ncountries, the U.S., and Singapore. Fourteen of them were operating globally. The interview partners had between several months to up \nto seven years of job experience in their current position. Some 21% of our interview partners were female. We provide full lists of the \ninterviews and analyzed projects—together with descriptive information on the interviews, the investigated projects, and the com -\npanies—in the appendix (projects in Table A.1 and interviews in Table A.2). \nWe continued to conduct interviews until we found a point of redundancy in the mechanisms identified and further data collection \ndid not add any new mechanisms (Corbin & Strauss, 2015; Lincoln & Guba, 1986, p. 203; Patton, 2002, p. 246). This manifested in our \nobservation that the identified types of ML value creation (and subtypes, see next section) did not change in the last quarter of in -\nterviews of our study. \nStructure and contents of the interviews \nThe retrospective accounts of our interviewees constituted the main data source for our research and theorizing process.
